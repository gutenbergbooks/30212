<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>AT THE RANCH.</h3>
</div>
<p>Avon Burnet, at the age of eighteen,
was one of the finest horsemen that ever
scurried over the plains of Western Texas,
on his matchless mustang Thunderbolt.</p>
<p>He was a native of the Lone Star State,
where, until he was thirteen years old, he
attended the common school, held in a log
cabin within three miles of his home, after
which he went to live with his uncle, Captain
Dohm Shirril, with whom the orphan son of
his sister had been a favorite from infancy.</p>
<p>Avon was bright, alert, unusually active,
and exceedingly fond of horses from the time
he was able to walk. His uncle had served
through the Civil War in the Confederate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
army, returning to Texas at the close of
hostilities, thoroughly &ldquo;reconstructed,&rdquo; and
only anxious to recover his fortunes, which
had been scattered to the four winds of
heaven during the long, bitter struggle.</p>
<p>The captain had no children of his own,
and it was natural, therefore, that he and
his wife should feel the strongest attachment
for the boy who was placed in their
care, and who, should his life be spared,
would inherit whatever his new parents might
be able to leave behind them when called to
depart.</p>
<p>Avon had reached the age named, when to
his delight he was told that he was to accompany
the large herd of cattle which was to be
driven northward, through upper Texas, the
Indian Nation, and Kansas over the Great
Cattle Trail, along which hundreds of thousands
of hoofs have tramped during the years
preceding and following the War for the
Union.</p>
<p>Young as was our hero, he had served his
apprenticeship at the cattle business, and was
an expert at the round-up, in branding, in cutting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
out, in herding, and all the arduous requirements
of a cowboy&rsquo;s life. It was understood,
therefore, that he was to be rated as a
full hand among the eight men who, under his
uncle, were to have charge of two thousand
cattle about to start on the long tramp northward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the hardest kind of work,&rdquo; said the
captain to his nephew, as the two sat in the
low, flat structure where the veteran made his
home, with his wife and one colored servant,
&ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t any fear that you will not pull
through all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am not able to do so <i>now</i>, I never shall
be,&rdquo; replied Avon, with a smile, as he sat on
the rough, home-made stool, slowly whittling
a piece of wood, while his aunt, looking up
from her sewing, remarked in her quiet way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be lonesome without Avon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not so bad as when uncle was off to
the war,&rdquo; ventured the youth, gazing affectionately
at the lady.</p>
<p>The captain was sitting with his legs
crossed, slowly smoking the old briarwood
which he had carried through many a fierce
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
campaign, and seemingly sunk in deep
thought. Like his nephew, he was clad in
the strong serviceable costume of the Texan
cowboy, his broad sombrero resting with
a number of blankets on pegs in the wall.</p>
<p>It was evening, with a cold, piercing wind
almost like one of the cutting northers blowing
around the homely structure. The herd
were gathered at a point about five miles to
the northward, whence the real start was to
be made at an early hour on the morrow.
This arrangement permitted the captain and
his young friend to spend their last night
at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Shirril, referring to the
last remark of her nephew, &ldquo;there never can
be any worse days than those, when I did not
know whether your uncle had not been dead
for weeks or possibly months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have had pretty tough times,
aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they might have been improved,
but Dinah and I managed to get along a great
deal better than some of our neighbors.
Here in Texas we were so far from the war
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
that I may say I never heard a hostile shot
fired, except by the Indians who came down
this way now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were the same, I suppose, that still
trouble us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so, mostly Comanches and sometimes
Kioways, with perhaps others that we
didn&rsquo;t know. They did much to prevent our
life from becoming dull,&rdquo; added the brave
little lady, with another smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The women in those days had to know
how to shoot the rifle, ride horses, and do the
work of the absent men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how we could have got along
if we hadn&rsquo;t learned all those things. For
years I never knew the taste of coffee, and
only rarely was able to obtain a pinch of
coarse brown sugar; but we did not suffer for
meat, and, with the help of Dinah, we could
get a few things out of the earth, so that, on
the whole, I think I had much easier times
than my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure of that,&rdquo; remarked Captain
Shirril, rousing himself; &ldquo;we had rough
days and nights, beyond all doubt, but after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
all, there was something about it which had
its charm. There was an excitement in battle,
a thrill in the desperate ride when on a scout,
a glory in victory, and even a grim satisfaction
in defeat, caused by the belief that we were
not conquered, or that, if we were driven
back, it was by <i>Americans</i>, and not by
foreigners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an odd way of putting it,&rdquo; remarked
the wife, &ldquo;but was it not the high
health, which you all felt because of your
rough outdoor life? You know when a person
is strong and rugged, he can stand almost
anything, and find comfort in that which at
any other time brings only wretchedness
and suffering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that had a good deal to do with
it, and that, too, may have had much to do
with sustaining you and Dinah in your
loneliness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain raised his eyes and looked at
two old-fashioned muzzle-loading rifles, suspended
on a couple of deer&rsquo;s antlers over the
fireplace, and smiling through his shaggy
whiskers, said:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You found them handy in those days,
Edna?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never could have got along without
them. They served to bring down a maverick,
or one of our own cattle, when we were
nearly starving, and sometimes they helped
drive off the Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Shirril shifted his position, as
though uneasy over something. His wife,
who was familiar with all his moods, looked
inquiringly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What troubles you, Dohm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t promised Avon that he should
go with me northward, I would make him
stay at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wife and nephew stared wonderingly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Comanches have been edging down
this way for more than a week past; I believe
they mean to make trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be supposed that such an
announcement as this caused dismay, but it
did not. Even Dinah, who was busy about
her household duties, and who heard the
remark, paused only a moment to turn up
her nose and say scornfully:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If dey&rsquo;ve done forgot how we allers sarve
de likes ob dem, jes&rsquo; let &rsquo;em try it agin.
Dat&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was a tall, muscular negress, whom
an ordinary man might hesitate to make
angry. She passed to another part of the
room, after muttering the words, and
seemed to feel no further interest in a subject
which ought to have made her blood
tingle with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Comanches are hovering anywhere
in the neighborhood,&rdquo; said Mrs. Shirril in
her gentle way, &ldquo;it is in the hope of running
off some of the cattle; you have them all
herded and under such careful care that this
cannot be done. When the Indians find you
have started northward with them, they will
follow or go westward to their hunting
grounds; surely they will not stay <i>here</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could believe as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why can&rsquo;t you, husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Indian nature is what it is;
you understand that as well as I. Finding
that they cannot steal any of our cattle,
they will try to revenge themselves by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
burning my home and slaying my wife and
servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they have tried that before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, but their failures are no ground
to believe they will fail again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the best ground we can have for
such belief.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>AN ALARMING INTERRUPTION.</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you think it best that I shall stay at
home, I will do so,&rdquo; said the young
man, striving hard to repress the disappointment
the words caused him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you shall not,&rdquo; the wife hastened
to interpose; &ldquo;everything has been arranged
for you to go with your uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there ever a wife like you?&rdquo;
asked the captain admiringly; &ldquo;there is more
pluck in that little frame of yours, Edna,
than in any one of my men. Very well;
Avon will go with us, but I can tell you, I
shall be uneasy until I get back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have neighbors,&rdquo; she continued, still
busy with her sewing, &ldquo;and if we need help,
can get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; observed the captain grimly,
&ldquo;I forgot that; Jim Kelton&rsquo;s cabin is only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
eight miles to the south, and Dick Halpine&rsquo;s
is but ten miles to the east; if the redskins do
molest you, you have only to slip in next
door and get all the help you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we have said, it was a chilly night in
early spring. The moon was hidden by
clouds, so that one could see but a short distance
on the open prairie. A fitful wind was
blowing, adding to the discomfort of outdoors,
and causing the interior of the cabin to be the
more comfortable by contrast.</p>
<p>But a few rods to the westward was a
growth of mesquite bush, in which the two
mustangs that the captain and his nephew
expected to ride were wandering at will. The
animals were so trained that either would
come at the whistle of his master, who, therefore,
felt sure of finding him at command
when wanted&ndash;&ndash;that is, provided no outsiders
disturbed him. This mesquite growth, consisting
of open bushes which attain a height
of eight or ten feet, extended over an area of
several acres, affording the best kind of hiding-place
for man or animal.</p>
<p>The signs of their old enemies, the Comanches,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
to which Captain Shirril referred,
had been noticed by his men, including young
Avon Burnet. They had seen the smoke of
camp-fires in the distance, had observed
parties of horsemen galloping to and fro, and,
in fact, had exchanged shots with the dusky
marauders when they ventured too near in
the darkness.</p>
<p>There could be no doubt that these fellows
were on the watch for a chance to stampede
the cattle, but the vigilance of the cowboys
prevented that disaster. Most of the latter
believed the Comanches would hover on
their flank, probably until the beasts were
well out of Texas and far over the line in the
Indian Nation or Kansas. That they would
stay behind to avenge themselves upon the
wife and servant of the captain was not to be
believed. The wife was equally certain on
that point, so their leader suffered himself
to be persuaded that his misgivings were
groundless.</p>
<p>But this feeling of security, which was felt
by all, suffered a startling interruption.</p>
<p>When Captain Shirril erected his humble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
cabin several years before, he did not forget
the danger to which he was certain to be
exposed from the Indians. The wooden walls
were heavy and bullet-proof, and the door
was capable of being barred so strongly at
an instant&rsquo;s warning, that nothing less than
a battering ram could drive it inward. The
windows were too narrow to admit the passage
of the most elongated redskin that ever
wormed himself into the camp of an enemy.
The structure was long and low, with an
upper story, in which the cowboys slept whenever
it was advisable to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have had so much experience with
this kind of business,&rdquo; said the captain,
&ldquo;that I suppose I ought not to feel uneasy,
even if I knew you would be attacked, for
there are two guns here ready for you and
Dinah, and you have both proven that you
understand how to use the weapons; there
is plenty of ammunition, too, and since you
have had full warning of what may possibly
take place&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant the resounding report of
a rifle broke the stillness on the outside,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
there was a jingle of glass, and the pipe
which Captain Shirril had held in his mouth
while talking was shattered as if from the
explosion of a torpedo within the bowl.</p>
<p>Nothing could have shown the wonderful
training of this little family in the perils of
the frontier more strikingly than did their
actions at this moment. Not a word was
spoken, but almost at the instant the alarming
occurrence took place, the captain, his
wife, and his nephew leaped backward with
lightning-like quickness. The movement
took the three out of range of the two windows
at the front of the house, with the
door midway between, those being the only
openings on the lower floor.</p>
<p>Dinah happened to be at the extreme rear,
where she was safe for the time. She was
about to advance, when checked by the crash
of the window pane and the crack of the rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For de Lawd&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;de warmints hab come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they have,&rdquo; replied the captain, rising
upright from his crouching posture, &ldquo;and see
what they have done!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>He held up the stem of his pipe, which he
had kept between his teeth during the exciting
moments, with such a grim expression of
woe that, despite the frightful incident, his
wife and even Avon smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pity indeed,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you will
have to use your new one, and I know how
much <i>that</i> will pain you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shall pay for this,&rdquo; he added with a
shake of his head.</p>
<p>Fortunately the rifles of himself and
nephew were leaning in the corner, where
they could be readily seized without exposing
themselves to another treacherous shot.
The men laid hands on them at once.</p>
<p>The weapons were of the repeating kind,
and among the best that money could buy
in San Antonio.</p>
<p>The two guns belonging to Mrs. Shirril and
their servant rested together on the deer&rsquo;s
prongs over the mantel, and, to reach them,
one must expose himself to another shot from
the outside.</p>
<p>Following the rifle report, the sound of
horses&rsquo; hoofs were heard galloping rapidly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
around the cabin. The captain listened intently
for a moment, holding one hand aloft
as a signal for the others to keep silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s fully a dozen of them,&rdquo; he said a
minute later in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they know you and Avon are here,&rdquo;
added his wife, who was standing motionless
just behind him, without any evidence of
excitement except that her face was a shade
paler than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so, judging from that,&rdquo; he
replied, spitting the stem of his pipe upon
the floor; &ldquo;but I must get those guns for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of it,&rdquo; she persisted, laying
her hand on his shoulder; &ldquo;you will surely
be shot, and there&rsquo;s no need of them yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well begin at once; you
haven&rsquo;t had any practice for months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gently removing the hand of his wife,
whom he loved as he did his life, the captain,
holding his own gun in hand, began moving
stealthily across the floor toward the fireplace.
Had he been on his feet, he must have been
observed by anyone in the position of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
savage that had fired the shot which was so
well-nigh fatal, but, while so close to the floor,
he would not be seen by any Comanche unless
he was quite close to the window.</p>
<p>The redskin might and might not be there:
<i>that</i> risk must be taken, or the guns would
have to be left alone for the time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shirril was more disturbed than ever,
for she knew as well as did her husband the
risk he ran, but she knew, too, that, when he
once decided to do a thing, it was idle to seek
to restrain him.</p>
<p>The burning wood threw an illumination
through the room which rendered any other
light unnecessary, and the captain could not
have been in clearer view had the midday
sun been shining. Nevertheless he crept
slowly forward, until in front of the fireplace.
Then he paused to consider which of two
methods he had in mind was the better for
obtaining the weapons.</p>
<p>The Comanches were still circling back and
forth on the outside, uttering their whoops
and firing their guns at intervals, though the
latter consisted of blind shooting, and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
meant to terrify the defenders, since none of
the bullets found its way through either of
the windows.</p>
<p>Captain Shirril took but a few seconds to
decide upon his course of action.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='CHAPTER_III_JUST_IN_TIME' id='CHAPTER_III_JUST_IN_TIME'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>JUST IN TIME.</h3>
</div>
<p>Bending as closely to the floor of the
cabin as he could, the Texan advanced
until directly in front of the crackling fire,
when he reached up with his Winchester,
which was grasped near the muzzle. By
this means he placed the stock directly
beneath the two weapons resting on the deer
antlers.</p>
<p>With a deftness that would hardly have
been expected, he raised both guns until
their stocks were lifted clear off their support,
when he began gently lowering them,
so as to bring them within his reach. He
might have flirted them free by a single
quick movement and let them fall upon
the floor; but he wished to avoid this, since
he ran the risk of injuring them.</p>
<p>None knew better than Avon Burnet the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
great danger of this apparently simple act
on the part of his uncle. The chances were
so immeasurably in favor of his discovery
that he was certain it would take place.
While the wife and servant held their
breath in a torture of suspense, the youth,
with his cocked rifle firmly grasped, stole
softly along the side of the cabin until close
to the door. In reaching the spot, he stooped
so as to move beyond the first opening, the
proceeding placing him between the windows,
with his left elbow against the heavy door.</p>
<p>In this situation his nerves were at the
highest tension. Everything was in plain
sight, but he was listening intently to the
movements of his enemies. He heard the
sounds of the mustangs&rsquo; hoofs, as they
circled swiftly about the cabin, sometimes
turning quickly upon themselves, and at
varying distances from the structure. Now
and then one or two of the horsemen would
rein up abruptly, as if striving to peer
through the openings, or about to apply for
admission.</p>
<p>It may seem incredible, but there is no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
reason to doubt the fact that, at the moment
Captain Shirril began cautiously reaching
upward with his weapon, the youth heard
one of the Comanches slip down from the
back of his mustang and approach the
door. His hand moved softly over the
rough surface, as though searching for the
latch string, which was generally hanging
out; and, finding it not, he began stealing
to the window just beyond.</p>
<p>This was the very thing Avon dreaded
above all others, for it was inevitable that
he should detect the figure of the Texan
operating so guardedly in front of the fire.</p>
<p>Such proved to be the fact. Whether the
youth actually observed the action of the
Indian, or whether he fancied he heard him
moving along the side of the house, cannot
be said with certainty; but a faint rustle in
front of the shattered glass made known
that the dusky miscreant was there, and
had detected the stratagem of the Texan,
who at that moment was in the act of
lowering the gun from the deer&rsquo;s prongs
over the mantel.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>His uncle was so clearly in his field of
vision that, without looking at him, Avon
did not miss the slightest movement, but
his whole attention was fixed on the window,
and it was well it was so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! look! Avon, do you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was his aunt who uttered the terrified
question with a gasp, as she pointed at the
narrow opening.</p>
<p>The youth had observed the object which
appalled the lady; the muzzle of a gun was
slowly gliding through the window.</p>
<p>Captain Shirril had been discovered, and
the Comanche was fixing his weapon in
position to fire a fatal shot. He might have
stood back a couple of paces and discharged
it without revealing his presence, but a
better aim could be secured by thrusting a
few inches of the barrel into the room.</p>
<p>At the instant the dark muzzle showed
itself and the gleam of the firelight was
reflected from it, Avon leaned his own rifle
against the door at his side, quickly drew
his revolver from the holster at his hip,
sprang forward like a cat, and seizing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
muzzle of the gun threw it upward toward
the ceiling.</p>
<p>It was done in the nick of time, for the
Comanche pressed the trigger just then, and
the bullet which, had Avon&rsquo;s action been delayed
a single moment, would have killed
Captain Shirril, was buried in the timbers
overhead.</p>
<p>The daring act brought the youth directly
in front of the window, where for the instant
he was exposed to any shot from the outside.</p>
<p>As he made the leap he saw the face of the
warrior, agleam with paint and distorted with
passion, but slightly flustered by the unaccountable
occurrence. Before he could recover,
and at the same instant, Avon darted
his revolver through the shattered window
pane and let fly with two chambers in quick
succession. An ear-splitting screech and a
heavy fall left little doubt of the success of
the daring act. The Comanche had not only
been hit, but hit hard.</p>
<p>Although startled by the noise and flurry,
Captain Shirril was too much of a veteran to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
be taken at fault. His big right hand closed
around the two weapons for which he had run
all this risk, and partly straightening up, he
bounded to the rear of the little room with
three rifles secure in his grasp, and with not
a hair of his head harmed.</p>
<p>Avon was as much on the alert as he, and
reached the shelter at the same moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was confoundedly more risky than I
supposed,&rdquo; remarked the captain, with a
smile and a shake of his head, &ldquo;but all&rsquo;s well
that ends well; I guess you dropped him, my
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, for I couldn&rsquo;t have
had a better chance,&rdquo; was the modest reply
of the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was one of the neatest things I ever
saw, and I&rsquo;m proud of you,&rdquo; exclaimed his
relative, slapping him affectionately on the
shoulder. &ldquo;I said you would count as a full
hand on the trip to Kansas, but at this rate
you&rsquo;ll add up double.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avon blushed as he used to do in school,
when his teacher praised him for excellent
lessons, and made no answer, but the eyes of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
his aunt kindled with love for the brave
fellow who, by his readiness of resource, had
saved her husband&rsquo;s life. Even Dinah, with
whom he had always been a favorite, added
an expression of affection for the boy who had
done so well.</p>
<p>There were now two men and two women
within the Texan&rsquo;s cabin, and each held a
trusty weapon, while there was plenty of
ammunition for all. It might well be asked,
therefore, what cause they had for alarm.</p>
<p>Outside were a dozen or more savage Comanches,
who are among the finest horsemen
in the world, and who in fighting ability and
bravery are surpassed by none, unless the
Apaches of the Southwest.</p>
<p>It was a piece of daring on the part of these
dusky raiders thus to attack the cabin, when
they knew how well it was defended. Captain
Shirril was probably right in supposing
they believed that he and his nephew were
with the rest of the cowboys, watching the
herd five miles away. Finding the couple
in the cabin, they could not resist the temptation
to bring down the head of the household,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
after which they must have supposed the rest
would be an easy task.</p>
<p>But having failed, probably they would
have withdrawn but for the shot of Avon
Burnet, that had brought down one of their
best warriors, and their well-known desire for
revenge urged them to the most desperate
measures against the whites.</p>
<p>But a few minutes&rsquo; whispered conference
at the rear of the cabin brought to light the
fact that every one of our friends, including
even Dinah, understood that their peril was
of the gravest nature conceivable.</p>
<p>The structure of the cabin was so thoroughly
seasoned by its years of exposure that
it would be an easy matter for their assailants
to set fire to it, and that they would
make the attempt was not to be doubted.
They always prepared for such action, and
none knew better than they its fearful effectiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might reach the boys by means of the
reports of our guns,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;if the
wind were not the wrong way, but they won&rsquo;t
catch the first sound, especially as they will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
have their hands full in looking after the
cattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But dey will obsarve de light ob de fiah,&rdquo;
suggested Dinah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly, but when they do see it,&rdquo;
said her master, &ldquo;it will be too late to help us.
They haven&rsquo;t a suspicion of anything of this
kind; if they had, they would be down here
like so many cyclones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one way of letting them know,&rdquo;
said Avon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By carrying word to them, and <i>I&rsquo;m going
to try it</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>A DESPERATE VENTURE.</h3>
</div>
<p>The family of Texans were not the ones
to indulge in sentimentality or useless
speculations when action was demanded.
The first feeling of amazement following
Avon&rsquo;s announcement of his resolution
quickly passed, but his uncle deemed it his
duty to impress upon him the desperate
nature of his scheme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see one chance in twenty of your
succeeding,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I stay what are the chances for us
all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly one in a hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall go,&rdquo; he quietly replied, compressing
his lips as his fine eyes kindled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is hope, if you can reach the bush,
but the rub will be to do <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They grow close to the house, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
Comanches will not be looking for any attempt
of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not best to wait until later?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Shirril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the sensible response of her
nephew; &ldquo;the prospect of success will decrease
with every passing minute. They will
think, and with reason, that we have repelled
their first attack so sharply that we are confident
of beating them off altogether. After a
time, when things begin to look bad for us,
they will look for something of that nature,
and be so well prepared for it that it will be
hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is right,&rdquo; assented the captain. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t ask you to try it, Avon, but, if you are
determined to do so, now is the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sentiments exactly, and I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dreaded anything in the nature of a
scene, one reason for his moving so promptly
being his desire to avert such a trial.</p>
<p>But now that the momentous step was
decided upon, the all-important question
remained as to the best means of making the
start.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></div>
<p>The whole interior of the lower story was
so brightly illuminated by the blaze on the
hearth that the moment the door was opened,
even for only a few inches, it would show
from the outside. Anxious as Avon was to
be off, he knew better than to start under
such conditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner that fire goes out, the better
for all of us,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;it is too
tempting to the scamps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the row of pegs near him hung several
heavy blankets, such as are used by all
plainsmen and cowboys. Those which the
captain and his nephew meant to take on
their journey northward were in camp five
miles away.</p>
<p>Setting down his gun, he lifted one of the
heavy pieces of cloth, whose texture, like the
celebrated blankets of the Navajoe Indians,
was almost close enough to be waterproof.
He paused for a minute to adjust the folds,
and then, forgetful of the danger he had run
a short time before, he stepped hastily across
the room, and stooping down flung the blanket
over the blaze so as to enclose it entirely.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>The effect was instantaneous. The room
was wrapped in darkness as dense as that
outside, though the consequences of the act
promised to be anything but pleasant in the
course of a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Avon, is your time!&rdquo; called the
captain in an undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off; good-by,&rdquo; came from the gloom
near the door, where the sounds showed that
he was engaged in raising the ponderous bar
from its sockets.</p>
<p>Captain Shirril stepped hurriedly to the
spot, and found the door closed but unfastened.
Even in his haste the youth did
not forget to shut it behind him, leaving to
his friends the duty of securing it in place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is gone; God be with him!&rdquo; he whispered
to his wife and servant, who with painfully
throbbing hearts had stepped to his side.</p>
<p>While speaking, he refastened the structure,
and in less time than it has taken to
tell it everything inside was as before, with
the exception that where there had been four
persons, there were now only three.</p>
<p>All forgot their own danger for the moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
in their anxiety for the youth, who had so
eagerly risked his own life to save them from
death.</p>
<p>Bending his head, the captain held his ear
against the tiny opening through which the
latchkey had been drawn earlier in the evening,
when the heavy bar was put in place.
The Texan was listening with all the intentness
possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems impossible that he should get
away,&rdquo; was his thought, &ldquo;and yet the very
boldness of his plan may give it success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shot from within the cabin, followed
so soon by the complete darkening of the
interior, must have caused some confusion
among the Comanches, for otherwise Avon
would have been shot or captured the moment
he stepped outside of the cabin.</p>
<p>For the space of two or three seconds Captain
Shirril absolutely heard nothing, except
the soft sighing of the night wind among the
mesquite bushes near at hand. The stillness
could not have been more profound had every
living thing been moved to a distance of a hundred
miles.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>He had listened only a minute or two, however,
when he heard a warrior run rapidly
around the building, coming to an abrupt stop
directly in front of the door. Thus he and
the Texan stood within a few inches of each
other, separated only by the heavy structure,
which, for the time, barred all entrance.</p>
<p>Captain Shirril even fancied that the eye of
the redskin was pressed against the opening,
in the vain effort to gain sight of the interior.
Had the Comanche chosen to place his lips
there, how readily he could have whispered
into the ear of his enemy!</p>
<p>That the Texan was right in suspecting one
of the warriors was so very near was proven
a moment later, when a second Indian
approached with his mustang on the walk,
dropped lightly to the ground, and coming
forward, halted so close to the door that he
almost touched it.</p>
<p>The captain knew this because he heard the
two talking in low tones. He understood the
tongue of the dusky miscreants, but though
he listened closely, could not catch the meaning
of a word that passed between them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
Their sentences were of the short, jerky
character common to all American Indians,
accompanied by a peculiar grunting, which
helped to obscure their meaning.</p>
<p>The unspeakable relief of the listener was
caused by the awakening of hope for his
nephew. He was certainly some way from the
cabin, for had he stayed near the door, discovery
was inevitable by the two warriors now
standing there. Indeed, they must almost
have stumbled over him.</p>
<p>But he might be still within a few paces,
unable to stir through fear of detection.
Extended flat on the ground, on the alert for
the first possible opening, he was liable to discovery
at every moment.</p>
<p>In fact, so far as Avon was concerned, he
had crossed the Rubicon; for, if seen, it was
impossible to re-enter the cabin, the door of
which had been shut and barred.</p>
<p>The warriors who had paused in front of
Captain Shirril kept their places but a brief
while, when they moved off so silently that he
could not tell the direction they took. Everything
remained still for several minutes, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
the listener once more fancied he heard something
unusual.</p>
<p>It was a stir among the mesquite bushes,
such as might be caused by a puff or eddy in
the wind, which blew quite steadily, though
with moderate force.</p>
<p>He was listening with all his senses strung
to the highest point, when the stillness was
broken by the report of a rifle, accompanied
by a ringing shriek, both coming from a point
within a few rods of the cabin. The hearts of
the inmates stood still, the wife alone finding
voice to exclaim in horrified tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Avon! he has fallen! he has given
his life for us!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>UPSTAIRS AND DOWNSTAIRS.</h3>
</div>
<p>Profound stillness followed the despairing
exclamation of Mrs. Shirril, who believed
that her nephew had gone to his death
while trying to steal away from the cabin
in which his friends were held at bay by the
Comanches.</p>
<p>The quiet on the outside was as deep and
oppressive as within. There was the sharp,
resounding report of the rifle, followed on
the instant by the wild cry of mortal pain,
and then all became like the tomb itself.</p>
<p>It was singular that the first spark of hope
was kindled by the words of the colored servant,
Dinah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you tink de boy am dead?&rdquo;
she asked, a moment after the woful words
of her mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear him cry out just now?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No; I didn&rsquo;t hear him nor did you
either; dat warn&rsquo;t de voice ob Avon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you know that?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Shirril, beginning to feel anew hope within her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo; o&rsquo; massy! habent I heerd de voice
ob dat younker offen &rsquo;nough to know it
&rsquo;mong ten fousand? Habent I heerd him
yell, too? he neber does it in <i>dat</i> style;
dat war an Injin, and de reason dat he
screeched out in dat onmarciful way war
&rsquo;cause he got in de path ob Avon and de
boy plugged him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gracious, Dinah! I believe you&rsquo;re
right!&rdquo; was the exclamation of Captain
Shirril, so joyous over the rebound from
despair that he was ready to dance a breakdown
in the middle of the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course I is right, &rsquo;cause I <i>allers</i> is
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there is some reason in that,
but please keep quiet&ndash;&ndash;both of you, for a
few minutes, while I listen further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women were standing near the captain,
who once more inclined his head, with his ear
at the small orifice in the door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>The seconds seemed minutes in length, but
as they wore away, nothing definite was heard.
Once or twice the tramp of horses&rsquo; feet was
noticed, and other sounds left no doubt that
most of the Comanches were still near the
dwelling.</p>
<p>This listening would have lasted longer, but
for an unpleasant though not dangerous interruption.
Dinah, who seemed to be meeting
with some trouble in her respiration, suddenly
emitted a sneeze of such prodigious force that
her friends were startled.</p>
<p>It was not necessary for them to enquire
as to the cause. The blanket that had been
thrown upon the flames, and which brought
instant night, did its work well, but it was
beginning to suffer therefrom. The fire was
almost smothered, but enough air reached
it around the edges of the thick cloth to
cause it to burn with considerable vigor, and
give out a slight illumination, but, worst of
all, it filled the room with dense, overpowering
smoke. Breathing was difficult and the
odor dreadful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will never do,&rdquo; said the captain,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
glancing at the fireplace, where the glowing
edges of the blanket were growing fast; &ldquo;we
won&rsquo;t be able to breathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His first thought was to fling another blanket
upon the embers, thereby extinguishing them
altogether, but his wife anticipated him
by scattering the contents of the water pail
with such judgment over the young conflagration
that it was extinguished utterly. Darkness
reigned again, but the vapor, increased
by the dousing of the liquid, rendered the
room almost unbearable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Dinah had better go upstairs,&rdquo;
said the captain to his wife; &ldquo;close the door
after you, and, by and by, the lower floor will
clear; I can get enough fresh air at the little
opening in the door and by the windows to
answer for me; if there is any need of you,
I can call, but perhaps you may find something
to do up there yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wife and servant obeyed, each taking
her gun with her, together with enough ammunition
to provide for fully a score of shots.</p>
<p>The cabin which Captain Dohm Shirril had
erected on his ranch in upper Texas was long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
and low, as we have already intimated. There
was but the single apartment on the first floor,
which served as a kitchen, dining and sitting
room, and parlor. When crowded his guests,
to the number of a dozen, more or less, could
spread their blankets on the floor, and sleep
the sleep that waits on rugged health and
bounding spirits.</p>
<p>The upper story was divided into three
apartments. The one at the end served for
the bedroom of the captain and his wife; the
next belonged to Dinah, while the one beyond,
as large as the other two, was appropriated by
Avon and such of the cattlemen as found it
convenient to sleep under a roof, which is
often less desirable to the Texan than the
canopy of heaven.</p>
<p>Few of these dwellings are provided with
cellars, and there was nothing of the kind
attached to the residence of Captain Shirril.
The house was made of logs and heavy timbers,
the slightly sloping roof being of
heavy roughly hewn planking. Stone was
scarce in that section, but enough had been
gathered to form a serviceable fireplace, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
wooden flue of which ascended to the roof
from within the building.</p>
<p>This brief description will give the reader
an idea of the character of the structure, in
which one man and two women found themselves
besieged by a war party of fierce
Comanches.</p>
<p>The ceiling of the lower floor was so low
that, had the captain stood erect with an
ordinary silk hat on his head, it would have
touched it. The stairs consisted of a short,
sloping ladder, over which a trap-door could
be shut, so as to prevent anyone entering from
below.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as smoke generally climbs upward,
the second story would have proven a
poor refuge had the women waited any time
before resorting to it. As it was, considerable
vapor accompanied them up the rounds of the
ladder, but, when the trap-door was closed
after them, the greater purity of the air
afforded both relief.</p>
<p>It will be recalled that the lower story was
furnished with two windows at the front, of
such strait form that no man could force his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
way through them. The upper floor was
more liberally provided in this respect, each
apartment having a window at the front and
rear, though the foresight of Captain Shirril
made these as narrow as those below. Indeed
they were so near the ground that otherwise
they would have formed a continual invitation
to hostile parties to enter through them.</p>
<p>So long as an attacking force kept off, three
defenders like those now within the house
might defy double the number of assailants
that threatened them. No implement of
warfare at the command of the red men was
sufficient to batter down the walls, or drive
the massive door from its hinges.</p>
<p>But the real source of danger has been
indicated. The cabin was located so far toward
Western Texas, that it was exposed to
raids from the Comanches and Kioways, while
occasionally a band of Apaches penetrated the
section from their regular hunting grounds in
Arizona or New Mexico.</p>
<p>Although the red men might find it impossible
to force an entrance, yet the darkness
allowed them to man&oelig;uvre outside, and lay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
their plans with little danger of molestation.
The roof of the building had been seasoned by
its long exposure to the weather, until it was
as dry as tinder. This was increased, if possible,
by the drought that had now lasted for
months in that portion of Texas. A slight
fire would speedily fan itself into a flame that
would reduce the building to ashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it only needs to be started,&rdquo; thought
Captain Shirril, when he found himself alone
below stairs, &ldquo;and it will do the work; it was
very thoughtful in Edna to dash that pailful
of water on the smouldering blanket, and it
quenched the embers, but, all the same, it
required the last drop in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, there was nothing to be feared in
the nature of thirst. The defenders could go
without drink easily enough for twenty-four
hours, and the issue of this serious matter
would be settled one way or other long before
that period passed. The cowboys would not
wait long after sunrise for their leader, before
setting out to learn the cause of his delay.</p>
<p>The question of life and death must be answered
before the rising of the morrow&rsquo;s sun.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>DINAH&rsquo;S DISCOVERY.</h3>
</div>
<p>When Captain Shirril told his wife that
she and the servant were likely to find
something to engage their attention above
stairs, he spoke more in jest than earnest, but
the remark served to prove the adage that
many a truth is spoken at such times.</p>
<p>Of course, the upper part of the house was
in as deep gloom as the lower portion, and the
women took good care in passing the windows
lest some stray shot should reach them.
They needed no light, for every inch of space
had long been familiar.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shirril walked quietly through the
larger apartment, without coming upon anything
to attract notice, after which she went
to her own room, Dinah accompanying her all
the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that there is any need of our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
remaining here,&rdquo; said the mistress, &ldquo;for there
is no possible way of any of the Indians effecting
an entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ceptin&rsquo; frough de trap-door,&rdquo; ventured
the servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is over your room, but the scuttle
is fastened as securely as the one below
stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno &rsquo;bout dat; I&rsquo;s gwine to see,&rdquo; was
the sturdy response of Dinah, as she walked
rather heavily into her own boudoir; &ldquo;any
man dat comes foolin&rsquo; &rsquo;round dar is gwine
to get hisself in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing precisely where the opening was
located (an unusual feature of the houses in
that section), she stopped directly under it,
and reached upward with one of her powerful
hands. The roof was still nearer the floor
than was the latter to the floor below, so that
it was easy for her to place her fingers against
the iron hook which held it in place.</p>
<p>Of course she found the scuttle just as it
had been for many a day; and Mrs. Shirril
was right in saying it was as firmly secured
as the ponderous door beneath them, for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
impossibility of getting a purchase from the
roof, made only a slight resistance necessary
from beneath. A dozen bolts and bars could
not have rendered it stronger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It &rsquo;pears to be all right,&rdquo; mused Dinah,
&ldquo;but folks can&rsquo;t be too keerful at sich times&ndash;&ndash;sh!
what dat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her ears, which were as keen as those of
her friends, heard a suspicious noise overhead.
It was faint, but unmistakable. The
startling truth could not be doubted: one of
the Comanches, if not more, was on the roof!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If dat isn&rsquo;t shameful,&rdquo; she muttered, failing
to apprise her mistress of the alarming
discovery; &ldquo;I wander what he can be after
up dar&ndash;&ndash;de Lor&rsquo; a massy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last shock was caused by a scratching
which showed that the intruder was trying to
lift up the scuttle.</p>
<p>Evidently the Indians had made themselves
as familiar with Captain Shirril&rsquo;s domicile as
they could without entering it. They had
noticed the scuttle, and the possibility that it
might be unfastened led one of them to climb
undetected to the roof to make sure about it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Dat onmannerly warmint knows dat dat
door am right over <i>my</i> room,&rdquo; muttered the
indignant Dinah; &ldquo;and instead ob comin&rsquo; in
by de reg&rsquo;lar way, as a gemman orter do, he&rsquo;s
gwine to try to steal in frough de roof. When
I get done wid him,&rdquo; she added, with rising
wrath, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll know better nor dat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Mrs. Shirril kept her place in her own
apartment, where she was striving so hard to
learn something, by peering through and
listening at one of her windows, that she
noticed nothing else, though, as yet, the noise
was so slight that it would have escaped the
ears of Dinah herself, had she not been quite
near it.</p>
<p>The colored woman groped around in the
dark until her hand rested upon the only
chair in the apartment. This she noiselessly
placed under the scuttle, and stepped upon it
with the same extreme care.</p>
<p>Her position was now such that had the
door been open and she standing upright, her
head, shoulders, and a part of her waist
would have been above the roof. She had
leaned her gun against the side of the chair,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
so that, if needed, it was within quick reach.
Then she assumed a stooping posture, with
her head gently touching the underside of the
door, and, steadying herself by grasping the
iron hook, she stood motionless and listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>he&rsquo;s dar</i>!&rdquo; was her instant conclusion,
&ldquo;and de wiper is tryin&rsquo; to onfasten de
skylight ob my obpartment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinah&rsquo;s many years spent in this wild
region had given her a knowledge that she
could not have gained otherwise. She knew
that so long as the Comanche contented himself
with trying to open the scuttle, nothing
was to be feared; but, baffled in that, he was
not likely to drop to the ground again without
attempting more serious mischief, and
that serious mischief could take only the
single dreaded form of setting fire to the
building.</p>
<p>It seems almost beyond belief, but it is a
fact that this colored woman determined on
defeating the purpose of the redskin, by the
most audacious means at the command of
anyone. She resolved to climb out on the
roof and assail the Comanche.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>Since she knew her mistress would peremptorily
forbid anything of the kind, she cunningly
took all the means at her command
to prevent her plan becoming known to Mrs.
Shirril, until it should be too late for her to
interfere.</p>
<p>Stepping gently down to the floor, she
moved the few steps necessary to reach the
door opening into the other room, and which
had not been closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is you dar, Mrs. Shirril?&rdquo; she asked in
a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dinah,&rdquo; came the guarded response;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t bother me for a few minutes; I want
to watch and listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; <i>dat</i> suits me,&rdquo; muttered the
servant with a chuckle, as she closed the door
with the utmost care.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to favor the astounding
purpose of the brave African, who again
stepped upon the chair, though in her first
confusion she narrowly missed overturning it,
and brought her head against the scuttle.</p>
<p>She was disappointed at first, because she
heard nothing, but a moment&rsquo;s listening told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
her that her visitor was still on deck, or rather
on the roof. The fact that, after finding he
could not effect an entrance, he still stayed,
made it look as if he was meditating mischief
of the very nature so much feared.</p>
<p>In accordance with her daring scheme,
Dinah now softly slipped the hook from its
fastening, holding it between her fingers for
a moment before doing anything more. Had
the Comanche known how matters stood, a
quick upward flirt on his part, even though
the hold was slight, would have flung the
door flat on the roof and opened the way to
the interior of the Texan&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>But not knowing nor suspecting anything
of the kind, he did not make the attempt.</p>
<p>With no more tremor of the nerve than she
would have felt in trying to kill a fly, Dinah
softly pushed up the door for an inch at its
outermost edge. This gave her a view of the
roof on the side in front, with a shortened
survey of the portion still nearer.</p>
<p>Her eyes were keen, but they detected nothing
of the Comanche who was prowling
about the scuttle only a few moments before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
The darkness was not dense enough to prevent
her seeing to the edge of the roof on all
sides, had her view been unobstructed. Could
she have dared to throw back the door, and
raise her head above the peak of the roof, she
could have traced the outlines of the eaves in
every direction.</p>
<p>But she was too wise to try anything like
that. The slightest noise on her part would
be heard by the Indian, who, like all members
of the American race, had his senses
trained to a fineness that seems marvellous to
the Caucasian. He would take the alarm on
the instant, and leap to the ground, or, what
was more likely, assail her with his knife,
since his rifle had been left below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s become ob dat villain?&rdquo; Dinah
asked herself, after peering about in the
gloom for a full minute; &ldquo;I wonder wheder
he hasn&rsquo;t got &rsquo;shamed ob hisself, and hab
slunk off and is gwine down to knock at my
door and ax my pardon&ndash;&ndash;Lor&rsquo; a massy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was good cause for this alarm on her
part, for at that moment she made a discovery
that fairly took away her breath.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>DINAH&rsquo;S EXPLOIT.</h3>
</div>
<p>The revelation that broke upon the senses
of the colored servant did not reach her
through her power of vision. She still saw
nothing but the all-encircling night, nor did
she hear anything except the sighing of the
wind through the mesquite bush, or the
guarded movements of the red men below.</p>
<p>It was her power of smell that told her
an appalling fact. She detected the odor of
burning wood!</p>
<p>The Indian whom she had heard prowling
like a hungry wolf over the roof, was there
for a more sinister purpose, if possible, than
that of gaining entrance through the scuttle
into the building. He had managed to climb
undetected to his perch for the purpose of
setting fire to the building, and not only that,
but he had succeeded in his design.</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_3' id='linki_3'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i001.jpg' alt='' title='' width='535' height='343' /><br />
<p class='caption'>
<span class='smcap'>A Startling Discovery.</span><br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>The same delicacy of scent that had told
the woman the frightful truth enabled her to
locate the direction of the fire. It was over
the peak of the roof, a little in front and to
the left.</p>
<p>Gazing toward the point, she observed a
dim glow in the darkness, such as might have
been made by the reflection of a lucifer
match. It was the illumination produced
by the twist of flame the Comanche had
kindled. If allowed to burn for a few
minutes, the wind would fan it into an inextinguishable
blaze.</p>
<p>How she managed to do what she did without
discovery she never could have explained
herself. But, holding the lid firmly grasped
with one hand, she lifted it up until it stood
perpendicular on its noiseless hinges.</p>
<p>As the door moved over to this position,
her head and shoulders rose through the
opening. Had her movements been quick,
instead of deliberate, they would have suggested
the action of the familiar Jack-in-the-box.</p>
<p>This straightening of her stature brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
her head several inches above the peak or
highest portion of the house, and, consequently,
gave her a view of the entire roof.</p>
<p>And looking in the direction whence the
odor came, and where she had caught the tiny
illumination, the brave colored woman saw a
sight indeed.</p>
<p>A brawny Indian warrior was stooped over
and nursing a small flame with the utmost
care. How he had managed the difficult business
thus far without detection from below,
was almost beyond explanation.</p>
<p>But it followed, from what has been told,
that he had climbed upon the roof, taking
with him some twigs and bits of wood, without
having been heard by Captain Shirril,
who was listening intently at the lower door,
and who heard more than one other noise
that must have been slighter than that overhead.</p>
<p>It was probable that the warrior, having
made his preparations, rode his horse close to
the further corner of the cabin, where he
stopped the animal, and rose to the upright
position on his back. The roof was so low
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
that it could be easily reached in this way,
and he was so far removed from the inmates
that his action escaped notice, his presence
being finally discovered in the manner
described.</p>
<p>Finding he could not open the scuttle, he
had crept over the peak of the roof, stooped
down, and, gathering his combustibles with
care, set fire to them. In doing this, he must
have used the common lucifer match of civilization,
since no other means would have
answered, and the American Indian of the
border is as quick to appropriate the conveniences
as he is to adopt the vices of the white
man.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, he had succeeded in
starting the tiny fire, and, at the moment
the wrathful Dinah caught sight of him, was
placing several larger sticks upon the growing
flame, and, bending over, was striving to
help the natural wind by blowing upon the
blaze.</p>
<p>The picture was a striking one. The glow
of the flame showed the countenance of the
Comanche plainly. His features were repellent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
the nose being Roman in form, while the
cheek-bones were protuberant and the chin
retreating. His long black hair dangled about
his shoulders, and was parted, as is the custom
among his people, in the middle. The
face was rendered more repulsive by the
stripes and splashes of yellow, white, and red
paint, which not only covered it from the top
of the forehead to the neck, but was mixed in
the coarse hair, a portion of whose ends rested
on the roof, as well as over his back.</p>
<p>As he blew, his cheeks expanded, his thin
lips took the form of the letter O, fringed
with radiating wrinkles around the edges, and
the black eyes seemed to glow with a light
like that of the fire itself, so great was his
earnestness in his work.</p>
<p>No country boy accustomed to get up on
cold mornings and build the family fires
could have done his work better. He saw
that while the sticks which were burning, and
which he continued to feed and fan, were
rapidly consuming and growing, they were
eating into the dry roof on which they rested.
They had already burned a considerable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
cavity, which gleamed like a living coal, and
it would not take long before a hold would be
secured that would throw the whole structure
into a blaze.</p>
<p>Dinah stood for several seconds gazing on
the picture, as though she doubted the evidence
of her own eyes. It seemed impossible
that such a cruel plot should have progressed
thus far without being thwarted. But the
next moment her chest heaved with indignation,
as she reflected that the red man
stretched out before her was the very one
that had tried to enter her apartment, and
being frustrated by her watchfulness in that
design, he was now endeavoring to burn them
all to death.</p>
<p>The fact that the Comanche never dreamed
of interruption caused him to withdraw his
attention from everything except the business
before him, and he continued blowing and
feeding the growing flames with all the care
and skill at his command. His wicked heart
was swelling with exultation when&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Suddenly an object descended upon the
flames like the scuttle-door itself, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
might be supposed to have been wrenched
from its hinges and slammed down on the
fire, quenching it as utterly and completely as
if it were submerged in a mountain torrent.</p>
<p><i>That</i> was the foot of Dinah.</p>
<p>Next, as the dumfounded warrior attempted
to leap to his feet, something fastened itself
like the claw of a panther in his long hair,
with a grip that not only could not be shaken
off, but which threatened to create a general
loosening at the roots.</p>
<p><i>That</i> was the left hand of Dinah.</p>
<p>At the same moment, when the dazed Comanche
had half risen and was striving to get
the hang of things, a vice closed immovably
about his left ankle, and his moccasin was
raised almost as high as his shoulder.</p>
<p>The agency in this business was the <i>right</i>
hand of Dinah; and instantly she got in her
work with the vigor of a hurricane. She possessed
unusual power and activity, though
it must not be supposed that the Comanche
would not have given a good account of himself
had he but possessed a second&rsquo;s warning
of what was coming. He had a knife at his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
girdle, though his rifle, as has been said, was
left behind with his companions, since his
business did not make it likely that he would
need anything of the kind, and it was an
inconvenience to keep it by him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You onmannerly willian! I&rsquo;ll teach you
how to try to sneak frough de roof into my
room!&rdquo; muttered Dinah, who was now
thoroughly aroused, &ldquo;yer orter have your
neck wringed off and <i>I&rsquo;ll do it</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Comanche was at vast disadvantage
in being seized with such a fierce grip by
the hair, which kept his face turned away
from his assailant, while the vicelike grasp
of his ankle compelled him to hop about on
one foot, in a style that was as awkward as
it was undignified. He realized, too, that
despite all he could do to prevent it, his foe
was forcing him remorselessly toward the
edge of the roof.</p>
<p>But the warrior was sinewy and strong.
He had been engaged in many a desperate
hand-to-hand encounter, though never in
anything resembling this. Finding the grip
on his hair and ankle could not be shaken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
off, he snatched out his keen-pointed knife
with the intention of striking one of his
vicious back-handed blows, which had
proved fatal more than once, but just then
the eaves were reached and over he went!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>IN THE MESQUITE BUSH.</h3>
</div>
<p>We must not forget our young friend,
Avon Burnet, who volunteered so
willingly to run every risk for the sake of
helping his relatives out of the most imminent
peril of their lives.</p>
<p>At the moment he saw Captain Shirril
start forward to smother the fire, by throwing
one of his heavy blankets over it, he
lifted the heavy bolt from its place, and
leaned it against the wall at the side of the
door. Having decided on the step, he was
wise in not permitting a minute&rsquo;s unnecessary
delay.</p>
<p>He stepped outside in the manner hinted,
drawing the door gently to after him. He
did not do this until he saw that the interior
was veiled in impenetrable gloom.</p>
<p>He felt that everything now depended
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
upon his being prompt, unfaltering, and yet
not rash. It may be said that the whole
problem was to learn the right step to take,
and then to take it, not an instant too soon
nor too late. That, however, sums up the
task of life itself, and the knowledge was
no more attainable in one instance than in
the other.</p>
<p>Finding himself in the outer air, Avon stood
a few seconds, striving, as may be said, to get
his bearings. He heard the trampling of
horses&rsquo; hoofs, several guarded signals passing
between the Indians, and was quite sure he
saw the shadowy outlines of a warrior moving
within a few paces of him.</p>
<p>While all this was not calculated to add to
his comfort of body and mind, it was pleasing
to the extent that it proved his presence on
the outside was as yet neither known nor
suspected. As my friend Coomer would say,
he was standing &ldquo;With the World Before
Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he dare not think he was so much as
on the edge of safety until he reached the
mesquite bush, whose location he knew so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
well, and whose dark outlines were dimly
discernible in front, and at the distance of
only a few rods.</p>
<p>The youth was thinking rapidly and hard.
It seemed to him that the Comanches would
naturally keep the closest watch of the front
of the cabin, and, therefore, he was less liable to
discovery if he made a dash from another point.</p>
<p>This conclusion was confirmed by the sudden
taking shape of not only the figure of
a horseman, but of a warrior on foot, who
approached at right angles, the two halting
in such a manner just before him that he
know it was but momentary, and that they
would come still nearer in a very brief while.</p>
<p>So long as he stood erect, with his back
against the side of the dwelling, he was invisible
to anyone who was not almost upon
him. Retaining this posture, and with the
rear of his clothing brushing against the building,
he glided softly to the right until he
reached the corner.</p>
<p>At the moment he arrived there, he saw
that the horseman had slipped from his mustang,
and he and the other warrior approached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
close to the door, where, as it will be remembered,
Captain Shirril heard them talking
together in low tones.</p>
<p>This was altogether too near for comfort,
and Avon, with the same noiseless movement,
slipped beyond the corner of the house.</p>
<p>As he did so, he felt for an instant that all
was over. An Indian brushed so near that
the youth could have touched him by extending
his hand.</p>
<p>How he escaped discovery was more than he
could understand. It must have been that
the warrior&rsquo;s attention was so fixed upon the
two figures at the front of the house that he
did not glance to the right or left. Even such
an explanation hardly makes clear the oversight
on the part of one belonging to a race
proverbial for its alertness and keen vision.</p>
<p>Before the young man recovered from his
shock, he was astounded by another occurrence
a hundred-fold more inexplicable. The
profound stillness was suddenly broken by
the ringing report of a rifle on the other side
of the building, accompanied by the wild cry
which caused the listening Captain Shirril and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
his wife to believe it meant the death of their
devoted nephew.</p>
<p>While the captain committed a grave mistake,
for which he was excusable, Avon was
equally at fault, and with as good if not a better
reason. Not dreaming it possible that he
could have a friend near the cabin and on the
outside, he supposed the shot was fired by the
captain to create a diversion in his favor.</p>
<p>While such, as the reader knows, was not
the case, yet it served that commendable
purpose.</p>
<p>The death-shriek of the stricken Comanche
was still in the air, when, assuming a crouching
posture, the youth made a dash for cover.
He expected every moment that other rifles
would be fired and he would be headed off.
He could hardly understand it, therefore,
when he felt the bushes strike his face, and he
knew that he was among the mesquite, without
suffering harm.</p>
<p>He would have continued his flight, had not
the sounds in front shown that while he had
been wonderfully fortunate up to this point,
he had run almost into a group of his enemies.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>The dense shadows of the bushes prevented
him from seeing them, else they assuredly
would have observed him, but, determined to
go forward now at all hazards, and eager to
seize the flimsiest thread of hope, he sank
down on his hands and knees, anxious to continue
his flight, but waiting to learn in what
direction it should be made, if indeed it could
be made at all.</p>
<p>There was one hope which he felt he must
give up. The possibility of finding Thunderbolt,
and using the matchless steed in his
flight to the camp of the cowboys, had occurred
to him more than once, though it
would seem that it was altogether too much
to look for any such good fortune as that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can only get clear of the parties, who
seem to be everywhere,&rdquo; was his thought,
&ldquo;I will run all the way to camp and bring the
boys back in a twinkling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could have drawn Thunderbolt to him
by a single emission of the well-known signal,
but such an attempt would have been the
before the mustang, even if he was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
already in their possession, and the act would
secure the capture of rider and steed beyond
peradventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be that my flight is unsuspected?&rdquo;
he asked himself, while he crouched on the
ground, uncertain which way to move, and
yet feeling that something of the kind must
be done.</p>
<p>It was useless to speculate, and, since his
foes appeared to be directly in his front, he
turned to the right, and began gliding slowly
forward, fearful that the beating of his heart
would betray him at every inch.</p>
<p>But the marvellous good fortune which had
attended him thus far was not quite ready to
desert him. With a care and caution beyond
description, he advanced foot by foot until he
drew a deep sigh of relief at the knowledge
that that particular group of red men was no
longer in front, but to the left and somewhat
to the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there are no more,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;it
begins to look as if I might succeed after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his rejoicing was premature. Not only
did he catch the sound of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
they were directly before him, and coming as
straight for the spot where he was crouching
as if the animal were following a mathematical
line.</p>
<p>One of the Comanches was riding through
the mesquite bush, and if the youth stayed
<a name='TC_1'></a><ins class="tnchg" title="Was 'were' in original text">where</ins> he was he must be trampled by the
mustang, unless the animal was frightened
into leaping aside and thus betraying him to
his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; muttered Avon, &ldquo;if it comes
to <i>that</i>, I know how to manage you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the thought passed through his mind, he
reached to his holster and drew his revolver.</p>
<p>At this moment the steed halted, though
he gave no sniff or sign that he had learned
of the stranger so close in front. Believing
a collision inevitable, Avon straightened up,
with his weapon firmly grasped.</p>
<p>But before he could use it the rider slipped
to the ground, and the next moment drew
a match along the side of his leggings. As
the tiny flame shone out in the gloom, he
held it up in front of his face to light the
cigarette between his lips.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
<a name='CHAPTER_IX_AT_FAULT' id='CHAPTER_IX_AT_FAULT'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>AT FAULT.</h3>
</div>
<p>As a rule the American Indian is not partial
to cigarette smoking, that being a
vice that he is willing to leave to his more
civilized brother; but the Comanche in front
of Avon Burnet, and so near him, left no
doubt of his purpose.</p>
<p>As the tiny flame burned more brightly,
he shaded it with his hands and puffed the
twisted roll of tobacco, like one who knew
how liable the blaze was to be blown out
by the wind that rustled among the mesquite
bushes. He was such an expert at the
business, however, that he met with no
difficulty.</p>
<p>The glow of the flame shone between the
fingers, where they slightly touched each
other, giving them a crimson hue, while
the point of the nose, the eyes, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
front of the face were revealed almost as
distinctly as was the countenance of the
warrior whom Dinah discovered in the act
of firing the roof of the cabin.</p>
<p>This Comanche was more ill-favored than
the other and was in middle life. There
was something in his appearance which
gave the youth the suspicion that he was
the chief or leader of the band of raiders,
though there could be no certainty on that
point.</p>
<p>Nothing would have been easier than for
Avon, from where he stood, to shoot down
the savage and appropriate his horse for
himself. There was an instant when he
meditated such a step, but though many a
veteran of the frontier would have seized
the chance with eagerness, he shrank from
such a deliberate taking of human life.</p>
<p>The youth had already shown his pluck and
readiness to use his weapon when necessary,
but he could not justify himself in an act like
the one named.</p>
<p>But he did not mean to stand idle when
there was a call for instant and decisive action.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></div>
<p>While the Comanche used his two hands
in manipulating his match and cigarette, his
rifle leaned against the limbs of one of the
largest mesquite bushes, where he could snatch
it up without stirring a foot.</p>
<p>It was not to be supposed that he had dismounted
for the purpose of kindling his
cigarette, for he could have done that on the
back of his mustang, as well as when on the
ground. He must have decided that he was
nigh enough to the other warriors to light his
tobacco before joining them on foot.</p>
<p>The youth was sure the steed before him
was a fine one, for it is rare to see one of those
people without an excellent horse, and he
resolved to capture it.</p>
<p>At the instant the match was at its best,
and the point of the cigarette was glowing red,
Avon stepped toward the motionless steed,
passing along the side which was furthest
from his master. The beast saw him on the
instant, and gave a slight whinny and
recoiled.</p>
<p>His master spoke sharply, while the cigarette
was between his teeth. Not suspecting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
the cause of his alarm, he supposed it was
trifling and gave it no attention. But when
his animal, with a loud snort, wheeled and
started off on a gallop, the Indian threw down
his match, called out angrily, and, grasping
his gun, sprang forward to intercept him.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the darkness was
more dense in the mesquite bush than on the
open prairie, and, although he caught a
glimpse of the vanishing mustang, he saw
nothing of the figure on his back, for the
reason that, when the nimble youth vaulted
thither, he threw himself forward on his neck.</p>
<p>The Indian must have been astonished by
the action of his animal, but he probably
concluded he would not wander far, and
would be within reach in the morning when
needed. So he refrained from attempting
anything like pursuit, which would have been
foolish under the circumstances.</p>
<p>It was a clever exploit on the part of Avon
Burnet, and he could not repress a feeling
of exultation over the success. Boldness,
dash, and peculiarly favoring circumstances
had taken him through the Comanche lines,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
when a repetition of the attempt would fail
ninety-nine times out of a hundred.</p>
<p>But while he was justified in being grateful,
there was enough serious business still
before him. He could not forget that the
friends in the cabin were in dire peril and
no time ought to be wasted in bringing
them relief.</p>
<p>The first indispensable act was to locate
himself, so as to gain an idea of the points
of the compass, without which it was beyond
his power to reach the camp of his friends.</p>
<p>A brief walk brought the horse out of the
bush and he stood on the open prairie. The
mustang was without saddle or bridle, except
a single buffalo thong, that was twisted over
his nose and by which his master guided him.
Avon had ridden the animals in the same way,
and since this mustang became tractable the
instant he felt anyone on his back, such an
equestrian as the young Texan met with no
difficulty whatever.</p>
<p>But he realized that a serious difficulty
confronted him when he attempted to locate
himself. The flurry in the bush had so mixed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
up his ideas of direction, that he was all at
sea.</p>
<p>Not a star twinkled in the cloudy sky, nor
could he tell in what quarter of the heavens
the moon was hidden. Looking in the supposed
direction of the cabin, he saw only
gloom, while it was equally dark when he
gazed toward the spot where he believed the
camp of the cowboys lay.</p>
<p>Between the home of Captain Shirril and
the spot where his men awaited his coming
were several elevations and depressions of
land, so that had the Texans been burning a
fire, as was likely, it would not show until
more than half the intervening distance was
passed. The cattle were herded to the northward,
so that in the event of a stampede it
was easier to head them on the right course
over the Great Cattle Trail.</p>
<p>A person placed in the situation of young
Burnet is apt to go astray, no matter how
extended his experience in wandering
abroad at night, unless he is able to start
right. This was the difficulty with Avon,
who was too wise to depend upon what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
impressions took possession of him, since it
is almost the invariable rule that such impressions
are wrong.</p>
<p>There was one faint hope: the Comanches
in the vicinity of the cabin had been indulging
in shouting and firing their guns. These
sounds would prove of great help, but to his
dismay, though he sat for several minutes
motionless on his mustang and listening, he
heard nothing of the kind.</p>
<p>He knew the wind was unfavorable, but he
was compelled to believe that he had ridden
much further than he first supposed, in order
to be beyond reach of the reports. After
mounting his mustang, he had sent him
scurrying on a dead run through the bush,
and kept it up for several minutes, before
emerging into the open country: that was
sufficient to take him a long way and, as he
believed, excluded the one means of guidance
which otherwise would have been his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helloa! what does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In peering around in the gloom, he saw,
apparently a long way off to the left, a star-like
point on the prairie, which shone out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
with an increasing gleam. Wondering what
it could signify, he sat for a minute or two,
attentively watching it, but unable to solve
the interesting question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Comanches are as fond of smoking as
are our men, and I suppose one of them has
some trouble in lighting his pipe or cigarette&ndash;&ndash;helloa!
there it goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light which was so interesting to him
suddenly went out, and all was blank darkness
again.</p>
<p>He waited and looked for several minutes,
but it did not reappear. At the moment it
vanished, he fancied he heard a slight sound,
but it was too indefinite to identify.</p>
<p>Had the young man but known that the
light which he had seen was burning on the
roof of his own home, and that it was Dinah
who extinguished it so abruptly, he would
have shaped his course far differently.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_X_A_SURPRISE' id='CHAPTER_X_A_SURPRISE'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>A SURPRISE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Avon Burnet waited several minutes
after the light went out, in the hope that
it would reappear and give him an indication
of its nature and cause; but darkness continued,
and he concluded that his first suspicion
was right: some warrior in riding over
the prairie had halted to light his cigar or
pipe, and then ridden on to join his comrades
near the cabin.</p>
<p>The youth was in the situation of the
mariner who finds himself adrift in mid-ocean,
without compass or rudder. Neither the sky
nor the ground gave him any help, and in
order to reach the camp of his friends he
must, under Heaven, rely upon his own
skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing certain,&rdquo; he concluded,
&ldquo;I shall never get there without making a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
break. I have secured a pretty good horse,
and I may as well turn him to account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heading in the direction which seemed
right, he tapped the ribs of the mustang with
his heels, and he broke at once into a sweeping
gallop, which, if rightly directed, was
sure to carry him to his destination in a
brief while.</p>
<p>Though it was too much for the young man
to believe he was following the true course, he
thought it was near enough for him to discover
the variation before riding far. He
ought to reach the crest of some elevation
which would so extend his view that he would
catch the gleam of the camp fire of the cattlemen.</p>
<p>As the pony galloped forward with that
swinging gait which he was able to maintain
for hours without fatigue, the rider glanced to
the right and left, in front and rear, on guard
lest he ran into unexpected danger, and
guarding against the approach of one or more
of his foes. His horse was tractable, but the
rider was disturbed now and then by his
actions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>While going with his swift gait, he occasionally
checked his speed so abruptly that,
had the young Texan been a less skilful
equestrian, he would have pitched over his
head. At such times he pricked his ears,
and snuffed and threw up his head, as though
frightened at something. But strive all he
could, Avon failed to discover the cause of
this peculiar behavior. He could neither
hear nor see anything to explain it.</p>
<p>Our young friend was so keenly on the
alert that he was quick to notice that they
were ascending quite a swell in the plain.
He drew the mustang down to a walk, and
when at the highest point of the elevation,
brought him to a stand-still.</p>
<p>No poor sailor, floating on a plank, ever
strove harder to pierce the gloom in quest of
a friendly light, than did Avon. His first
glance in the direction which seemed to him
to be right failed to show that which he
longed to see. Then he slowly swept the
horizon with the same searching scrutiny.</p>
<p>Not the first star-like glimmer rewarded
him. Blank darkness enclosed him on every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
hand. It was right above, below, to the right
and left and to the front and rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be shot if this doesn&rsquo;t beat
everything!&rdquo; was his exclamation, when he
came to understand his helplessness; &ldquo;it
looks as if I would have done the folks a great
deal more good if I had stayed with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slipping down from the back of his mustang,
which he took care to hold by means of
the halter, Avon pressed his ear to the earth,
as is the practice of those in a similar
situation.</p>
<p>At first he thought he detected the sounds
of hoofs, but the next moment he knew it was
only fancy. The better conductor in the form
of the ground told him no more than did the
gloom that surrounded him.</p>
<p>While thus engaged, the mustang tugged at
the rope, as if wishing to free himself. He
must have felt that he was controlled by a
strange hand, but his efforts were easily
restrained.</p>
<p>As nearly as Avon could judge, he had
travelled more than two miles since leaving
the cabin, so that, provided he had followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
the proper course, he must have passed half
the distance. But if that were the case, he
ought to see signs of the camp. It is the custom
of the cattlemen, when on the move, to
keep a lantern suspended from the front of
the provision wagon, to serve as a guide for
the rest, and this ought to be visible for
several miles to one in his elevated position.</p>
<p>Holding the thong in one hand, the youth
now pointed his Winchester toward the sky
and discharged several barrels, in the hope
that the reports would reach the ears of the
Texans and bring a response from them. The
mustang did not stir a muscle; he was so
accustomed to that sort of thing that his
nerves were not disturbed.</p>
<p>This appeal was equally futile, and, as Avon
flung himself again upon the back of his
horse, a feeling akin to despair came over
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was quite an exploit to get
through the Comanche lines without harm,&rdquo;
he said to himself, &ldquo;but of what avail? I
shall wander round and round until daylight,
with no more knowledge of where I am than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
if I were groping among the Rocky Mountains;
and, long before the rise of sun, the
fate of Uncle Dohm and the folks will be
settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A feeling of exasperation succeeded his
depression of spirits. It was beyond endurance
that he should be so near help and yet be
unable to secure it. If he could but gain an
inkling of the right course, he would dart
across the prairie with the speed of an arrow.</p>
<p>He had neglected no possible means of informing
himself. Recalling the direction of
the wind, he strove to make use of that; but
as if even the elements had united against him,
he was not long in discovering that the wind
was fitful and changing, and his attempt to
use it as a guide had much to do with his
going so far astray.</p>
<p>The rifle was discharged again, but the
listening ear caught no response, and the conviction
forced itself upon him that, instead of
journeying toward the camp, he was really
further from it than when he started.</p>
<p>The mustang began to grow restless once
more. Avon spoke sharply, and started him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
off without any attempt to guide him. To his
surprise, the steed turned to the left almost at
right angles, and without any urging on his
part, broke into a canter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that,&rdquo; said the rider;
&ldquo;he certainly knows more than I do, but it is
too much to expect him to carry me to my
destination without any direction from me.
But he is as likely to be right as wrong, and
so I&rsquo;ll let him do as he chooses. You&rsquo;re a
mighty fine animal,&rdquo; continued the youth,
as the steed broke into a gallop, &ldquo;but I
wouldn&rsquo;t give Thunderbolt for a hundred
like you; he knows something, and when
I&rsquo;m caught in a fix like this, he is sure to
help me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth feared that the mustang was
trying to return to his master. He, therefore,
brought him down to a walk, though he broke
into a canter more than once, and leaning forward,
peered through the gloom, on the alert
for the first sign of danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Dohm believed the Comanches
meant to set fire to the house; if he hadn&rsquo;t
thought so, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been in this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
plight; it strikes me that it is about time they
made a start; if they do so, I will take a
hand in that little game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the first glow anywhere in the sky, telling
of the use of the torch, Avon would have
driven his mustang thither like the whirlwind,
and it is safe to believe that his Winchester
would have done more effective
service than ever before. But the bright eyes
which continually scanned every portion of
the murky heavens caught no glimmer of a
single star.</p>
<p>The mustang gave a slight whinny and
rose to a canter again, but was roughly
checked by his new master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the mischief is the matter with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, something took shape in the
gloom ahead. Avon stopped his steed and
leaned forward. Yes; it was unmistakable.</p>
<p>There it stood&ndash;&ndash;a long, low cabin, whose
familiar contour told the alarming fact that
he had come back to his starting-point, and
was among the Comanches in front of his own
home!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>CHANGING PLACES.</h3>
</div>
<p>The triumph of the colored servant Dinah
over the Comanche incendiary may be
described as overwhelming in its way.</p>
<p>The redskin was caught at so great disadvantage,
that he was hurled from the roof
before he could check himself or make use of
the knife he had snatched from his girdle.
Indeed, it was at the instant of striking his
vicious blow that he went over the eaves.
This preserved his awkwardness of posture,
and prevented his making any preparation
for the violent fall.</p>
<p>The miscreant would have struck the ground
with a &ldquo;dull thud,&rdquo; but for an unexpected
buffer in the shape of one of his brother warriors,
who happened to be standing directly
under. As a consequence, the sprawling
figure came down on the head and shoulders
of the astounded Comanche, who collapsed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
with a feeling that must have made him suspect
the house had fallen on him.</p>
<p>The mishap saved the victim of Dinah&rsquo;s
wrath, but at a stunning cost to the under fellow,
who lay for a minute or two as if dead,
before he was able to regain his breath and
climb to his feet.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the author of this catastrophe
was wise enough to improve the
moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dar!&rdquo; she muttered, checking herself on
the edge of the roof, &ldquo;I reckons you know a
blamed sight more dan you eber did afore,
and arter dis, when you tries to steal into a
&rsquo;spectable lady&rsquo;s room, you&rsquo;ll knock at de
doah fust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not to be supposed that in the darkness
the Comanches below would grasp the
situation offhand, and, before they could do
so, Dinah scurried over the peak of the roof
to the scuttle, which of course was still open,
and descended. In her haste, she stepped
upon the back of the chair, which tripped
over, and she went down with a crash that
shook the entire building.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>Mrs. Shirril dashed into the room, in
consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in Heaven&rsquo;s name is the matter,
Dinah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nuffin&rsquo;s de matter wid <i>me</i>, but I guess it
am all day wid dat cheer, howsumeber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain hurried up the ladder, flung
back the covering, and leaped into the apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s killed? What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;
he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nuffin,&rdquo; replied the servant, impatient
with the continued questioning; &ldquo;I&rsquo;s been
promenadin&rsquo; a little on de roof and de cheer
flopped ober when I sot my foot on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything being in darkness, the eyes of
the party were useless. The captain groped
around to help Dinah to her feet, but she was
already there, sound in limb and body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wants sumfin to do, capting,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;jes&rsquo; fasten dat doah above yer
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How came it open?&rdquo; he asked, as he
hastily complied, still unable to comprehend
what had taken place.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Habent I jes&rsquo; tole yer dat I&rsquo;s been out on
de roof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard her there,&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;and
was on my way to learn what it meant, when
the crash came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In answer to the questions of the couple,
Dinah soon made clear what had taken place.
Her employers were filled with admiration of
her pluck, and wonder at its brilliant success.
That she had saved the dwelling from burning
and averted a frightful death from them all was
evident. They praised her highly, though the
captain insisted that she ought to have told
him of her intention before climbing through
upon the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cotch me doin&rsquo; <i>dat</i>,&rdquo; she chuckled,
&ldquo;when I knowed dat you would hab stopped
me. Dinah aint as big a fool as she looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one certainly could have managed it
with the skill shown by you. I would have
kept within the opening and shot the scamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would you hab done wid de
fiah, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it out in some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And got shot yourself! Your fut isn&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
<a name='TC_2'></a><ins class="tnchg" title="Was 'as as' in original text">as</ins> promisc&rsquo;us as mine and it would hab tooken
you longer; it wanted only one slap ob my
shoe and de bus&rsquo;ness war done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you were right,&rdquo; said the captain
with a laugh; &ldquo;but I am afraid we are
not through with those attempts; they came
so near succeeding that they will soon try
it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t t&rsquo;ink dat black rascal will try it
wery soon, &rsquo;cause I gib him a shookin&rsquo; up
dat he wont git ober for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt of that, but there are
others just as venturesome as he, and they will
try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is not that the only source of danger?&rdquo;
asked the wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can hardly be said to be so, but it&rsquo;s the
chief source; I will stay here, and you,
Edna, had better go below; the room is so
well cleared of smoke that it will cause you
little trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is I gwine to do?&rdquo; asked
Dinah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may accompany your mistress; if I
find myself in need of you I will call.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;s afeard you won&rsquo;t t&rsquo;ink yourself in need
ob me, if some more ob dem scamps come
pokin&rsquo; round de doah up dere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will try to take care of them myself,
but I give you my word if your help is
needed it will be asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the most that the servant could
get from her master, and she had no choice
but to do as directed. Mrs. Shirril led the
way down the ladder, followed by her servant,
and they quickly found themselves on
the lower floor.</p>
<p>Enough smoke remained in the room to
cause Dinah another fit of sneezing, but the
shattered window and the opening of the
door at the head of the primitive stairs gave
such good vent that a rapid improvement
took place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that there is much for us to
do,&rdquo; remarked the mistress, taking her place
near the door, and out of range of either of
the windows, &ldquo;but they may try something
of which we have no suspicion, and, if so,
we shall have the chance to do better service
here than above stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Poserbly, but it doesn&rsquo;t strike me dat
way; seems to me dat fiah am &rsquo;ginning to
flare up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smothering blanket by this time was
so far consumed that the embers showed
beneath, though with less strength than at
first. They diffused a slight illumination
through the room, and enabled the two
women to see each other&rsquo;s figures dimly, as
they moved silently about, alert, listening,
and watchful.</p>
<p>The embers could have been extinguished
by making use of the same means as before,
but the certainty of a denser volume
of strangling smoke, to say nothing of the
loss of the valuable article, prevented any
use of the remedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bress my soul, if dar isn&rsquo;t anoder warmint!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinah, rifle in hand, had stationed herself
by the heavy door, against which she slightly
leaned. As she did so, she felt an almost
insensible yielding on its part, as though a
powerful pressure on the outside was being
exerted to force it inward.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How can you know that?&rdquo; asked her mistress,
stepping to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jes put your hand right here and feel for
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The delicate hand of the lady was placed
against the structure, and there could be no
doubt that someone was pushing strongly
against the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she in a low voice, &ldquo;they are
there, but they can do no harm, as long as they
confine themselves to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose dey butt dar heads agin it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be worse for their heads than for
the door, but I think your people are the only
ones who work that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause we hab de hardest kind ob
heads,&rdquo; was the truthful response; &ldquo;but
mebbe dey&rsquo;s usin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; else to break in
de door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can do no injury if they do,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. Shirril, who could not shake off a feeling
of uneasiness because of the discovery.</p>
<p>While it was apparent that the door could
not be forced by any conceivable means at
the command of the Comanches, there was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
doubt as to their precise intentions that
troubled the good woman. She had the proof
that their relentless enemies were busy, and
their well-known cunning was likely to suggest
ways of reaching their end, which, for a
time at least, must remain unsuspected by the
defenders of the cabin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>ON THE ROOF.</h3>
</div>
<p>Captain Dohm Shirril was never
more in earnest than when he declared
that the Comanches meant to renew their
attempt to fire his cabin.</p>
<p>Having come so near success, they would
resort to the same means, taking care to
provide against a second ignominious defeat
at the hands of the defenders.</p>
<p>The darkness, on the whole, was far more
helpful to the latter than to their assailants,
for, if care was used, it was beyond the
power of the Indians to discover the presence
of any person on the roof. The Comanches,
from the force of circumstances,
would have to move back some rods from
the building, to see the cover, and that distance
was sufficient to shut out all sight of
a figure, so long as it remained prone. If a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
man rose to his feet, as Dinah had done,
his outlines would show, and he would
become an instant target for the redskins.</p>
<p>It was with a full conviction of these important
facts that the Texan, imitating the
action of his servant, unfastened the scuttle,
and noiselessly let it fall back behind him.
Then he thrust his head and shoulders
through and scanned the half of the roof in
his field of vision.</p>
<p>Nothing to cause alarm was discerned,
and rising still higher, he peered over the
peak to the other side.</p>
<p>The air had the odor of burning wood,
and the cavity burned in the roof showed
signs of life, but they were so slight as to
be harmless. They would soon die out,
despite the strong wind still blowing.</p>
<p>It need not be said that the Texan had
not the remotest intention of following the
example of his servant. If he should discover
the presence of an Indian on the roof,
little fear of an attempt to steal upon him
unaware and fling him to the earth below.
The captain held his Winchester firmly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
grasped and most of its chambers were
charged. That offered the true solution of
his problem, in case of the appearance of
danger, and he was not the man to hesitate
in such an emergency.</p>
<p>He did not fail to notice that which was
observed by his nephew: the Comanches had
ceased their whooping and firing, though
the tramping of their mustangs proved that
most of the warriors were still mounted
and circling back and forth in the aimless
effort to detect some means of getting at
the defiant inmates of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avon has given them the slip,&rdquo; was his
conclusion, &ldquo;though he must have had a
close call. There is one Indian less, at any
rate, than when he stole out of the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the fact, though, as we have
shown, he did not fall by the rifle of the
youth.</p>
<p>The Texan was standing on the chair in the
upper room, with his head and shoulders
through the opening, all his senses on the
alert, when he caught the faint report of a
rifle, repeated several times. The sounds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
came from a point a long way off, and he
could only conjecture their cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was over yonder,&rdquo; he added, referring
to a point of the compass almost opposite,
&ldquo;I would believe the boy fired the gun
and had come in collision with some more of
the scamps that are so plenty to-night, but he
can&rsquo;t be over there, because that would lead
him further from the camp of the cattlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, as the reader suspects, the rifle
was discharged by the young man, who, in
obedience to the general law, had strayed in
the wrong direction in his blind search for
his friends.</p>
<p>It was not necessary to give any attention
to matters below stairs. He could not believe
that danger threatened there, but, should it
appear in an unexpected form, the women
would give quick notice, and he could hasten
to their aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avon ought to reach camp in half an
hour,&rdquo; continued the Texan, following his
train of thought; &ldquo;true, he is on foot, but he
knows every step of the way, and won&rsquo;t allow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
the grass to grow under his feet; it will take
the boys about half a minute to make ready;
the cattle can be left to themselves, so they
ought to be here within three-quarters of an
hour, and won&rsquo;t they make fur fly when they
do come!&rdquo; added the Texan with a thrill;
&ldquo;they will welcome such a chance to even up
matters with these cattle thieves, who have
been hanging round the country for nearly a
week; they will give them a lesson which
will make it safe for the women until we get
back, even if gone six months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite his watchfulness against his foes,
his gaze continually wandered to the northward,
whence the expected aid was to come.
His elevation was not sufficient to permit him
to see beyond the ridge which his relative
must pass to reach camp, but he listened for
the assuring shouts which were sure to proclaim
the arrival of the brave fellows who
were always ready to risk their lives for a
friend.</p>
<p>Although the captain relied chiefly upon
the darkness to screen him from sight of the
Comanches, he could not feel sure of entire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
safety in his situation. In order to hold all
of the roof in his field of vision, he had to
keep not only his head but his shoulders
above the level of the scuttle. By doing this,
he could look over the peak, but his danger
lay in the evident fact that the Indians knew
the location of the opening, and would use
their eyes for all they were worth in striving
to detect anyone venturing out of it.</p>
<p>The conviction, therefore, was that his
conspicuous posture was likely to reveal his
outlines to some watchful warrior, who might
rise to his feet on the back of his steed so as
to permit a closer view of the roof.</p>
<p>No more uncomfortable sensation can be
imagined than that of one who continually
invites the skill of a sharp-shooter, and the
Texan met the difficulty not by shrinking,
like a turtle, within his protection, but by
climbing stealthily out upon the planking,
where he remained extended at full length.</p>
<p>This rendered him less liable to be seen, but
if his assailants should take a notion to sweep
the deck, as may be said, with rifle bullets,
he was far more likely to receive some of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
them in his person than he would be by
retaining his former place.</p>
<p>But a greater or less degree of danger must
attend any effort to frustrate the designs of
the red men, who were inspired by a hatred
intensified by the loss of two of their number.</p>
<p>With his face almost pressing the planking
the Texan drew himself, inch by inch, along
the roof, until he was some six feet distant.
Then he paused and listened, slightly raising
his head and peering around in the gloom.</p>
<p>Once he heard the hoofs of a galloping
horse, which, however, quickly ceased. Then
several whistle-like signals passed between the
marauders, and he was able to catch the murmur
of voices within the cabin. The wife and
servant were talking together, and, though
their words were low, the open doors allowed
the slight noise to reach the ears of the Texan,
without telling him what words were spoken.</p>
<p>Holding his position several minutes, he
turned a little to the left and crept along, until
able to look over the low peak of the roof.
He did this by raising his head the few inches
necessary to bring his eyes just above the level.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>Everything, so far as he could judge, was
the same as before. The smouldering in the
cavity had died out, though the smoke was as
pungent as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinah could not have done her work more
effectively, and a reasonable person ought to
be satisfied&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His keen sense of hearing apprised him of a
noise, slight but significant, near him. His
first thought was that it was in front, but the
next moment he knew it came from the rear.
Turning his head in that direction, without
moving his body, he caught the outlines of a
Comanche&rsquo;s head at the lower corner of the
roof behind him. It slowly rose until the
shoulders appeared, and no doubt remained
that the Indian was cautiously climbing
upon the roof, to renew the attempt to set
fire to it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>A DEAD RACE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Avon Burnet was thunderstruck.
When he supposed he was several miles
from the cabin of his uncle, he found himself
directly in front of it, and the Indian horse,
upon which he relied to take him to the camp
of the cattlemen, had brought him to what
might be called the mouth of the lion&rsquo;s den.</p>
<p>Not only had the precious minutes been
thrown away, but his peril was of the most
desperate nature.</p>
<p>Hardly had the pony halted, when a couple
of figures loomed to view in the darkness on
the left, and one of them called to him in
Comanche. This told the youth that his
identity was unsuspected by the red men,
whose view was too indistinct to distinguish
him from one of their own number. But they
were coming toward him, and his broad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
sombrero must reveal the truth the next
instant.</p>
<p>Not a second was to be lost. They were
almost upon him, when he wheeled and urged
his mustang to a dead run, throwing himself
forward at the same moment, in the usual
way, to avoid the bullets that would be whistling
about him before he could pass beyond
reach.</p>
<p>But the steed got the mischief in him at
this moment. He must have understood
the treachery demanded of him, for instead of
dashing off, as was expected, he spitefully
flung his head from side to side and reared,
with his fore-legs high from the ground.</p>
<p>Had Avon been on the open prairie, with
time at his command, he would have conquered
the beast, as he had done many a time
with others, but he could not do so now.
There was not the twinkling of an eye at his
disposal.</p>
<p>The mustang was still rearing and pawing
the air, when Avon whisked over his shoulder,
like a skilled equestrian, landing nimbly
on his feet, and breaking into a dead run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
toward the cattle camp five miles away. His
action, as well as that of his horse, made
known the astonishing truth to the approaching
Comanches.</p>
<p>Several warning whoops broke the stillness,
and it seemed to the fugitive that half the
Indians were in pursuit of him. He glanced
back and was not a little surprised to observe
that all were on foot. The pony which had
just been freed must have concluded to enjoy
his liberty while the chance was his, for,
instead of going to his master, he galloped
whinnying in another direction.</p>
<p>But all of these men had mustangs, which,
as has been said, were among the finest of
their species, and they were likely to take
part in the singular contest.</p>
<p>If the chase should retain its present character
the young man had hope, for he was one
of the fleetest of Texans, who had never met
his superior among the veterans of the plains.
The Comanches are also wonderfully active on
foot, and it remained to be decided whether
they could overtake him in a fair contest.</p>
<p>Avon Burnet ran as never before. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
speeding now for his own life as well as for
that of his friends, for they were in as urgent
need of help as ever. He knew his face was
toward camp, he remembered the nature of
the ground, and had no fear, therefore, of
stumbling into any pitfalls.</p>
<p>Accustomed as the Comanches were to running,
they must have been surprised at the
burst of speed shown by the young man, who
seemed to be going over the plain like the
wind.</p>
<p>As he ran Avon cast furtive glances over
his shoulder, and his heart tingled when he
saw that he was steadily drawing away from
the four figures which seemed to have sprung
from the ground itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it up, boys,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;and see
where you land. If you can down me in <i>this
style</i>, you are welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was not to be expected that the pursuers
would content themselves while the
swift-footed youth left them out of sight.
The moment they saw that such an issue was
likely, they would resort to their rifles, and
there could be no question of their skill with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
those weapons, which they had been accustomed
to use from the hour they were strong
enough to hold one of them.</p>
<p>There must have been some urgent wish on
the part of the red men to capture the youth,
else they would have appealed to their guns
at first. The rearing mustang served as a
partial shield to the fugitive, until he was
fairly under way and had secured a start of
several rods, in fact being almost invisible in
the gloom at the moment the race fairly
opened.</p>
<p>The third glance over his shoulder showed
him only two of the Comanches in sight, and
hardly half a minute elapsed, when, on looking
back again, only one was visible.</p>
<p>But the fact became speedily apparent that
this particular red man was as fleet as himself.
He must have been the champion of his
tribe, since he parted company with his companions
so speedily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I can shake you off
or not,&rdquo; thought the fugitive, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a
mighty sight better to be chased by a single
enemy than by several.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>The youth determined upon a piece of
strategy, should it prove possible. He meant
to keep up the flight, without escaping his
pursuer, until he was drawn so far away from
the rest that he could receive no help from
them. This, at the same time, would encourage
the miscreant in the belief that he would
soon overhaul and make him prisoner.</p>
<p>The first part of the scheme was comparatively
simple. It was easier to allow the
scamp to gain upon him than it was to outrun
him; it was somewhat more difficult to hold
the rates of speed relatively equal, while it
looked extremely doubtful whether, when the
moment should arrive, he could leave him
behind.</p>
<p>In support of this view, Avon did not fail to
remember that he had put forth his utmost
exertion from the first, and still was unable to
shake off his enemy, who clung as persistently
to him as does the wolf to the wounded
bison.</p>
<p>What he feared, too, as much as anything
else, was that the other Comanches, who had
withdrawn from the race, would hasten to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
vicinity of the cabin, and, mounting their
mustangs, take part in the struggle. If a
horseman should get but a single glimpse of
him, it would not take him long to run the
fugitive down.</p>
<p>It was this dread which caused him to
swerve gradually to the left, though he kept
such careful note of the change that there was
no danger of his going astray as before.</p>
<p>None of the pursuers, from the moment of
starting, gave vent to any outcry, as they are
generally supposed to do under similar circumstances.
Such a proceeding would have
been as great a draught upon his strength as
outright laughter, and the American Indian is
too wise not to husband every resource.</p>
<p>It required little cessation of effort to permit
the Comanche to come up with him at an
alarming rate. A few minutes would have
allowed the pursuer to overhaul the fugitive.</p>
<p>Only a few minutes had passed since the
furious start, and Avon felt that the time had
come to consider himself as dealing only with
this single redskin. Still bearing to the left
he put forth all his energies, resolved to run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
away from him, if the achievement was within
the range of possibility.</p>
<p>It was not. Try as desperately as he
might, the Comanche could not be shaken
off.</p>
<p>An encounter being inevitable, Avon had to
decide upon the manner in which it should
take place.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the warrior must have felt certain
of coming up with him, he was not likely
to appeal to his rifle, or that would have
been his first act when the contest opened.
He would continue to run until near enough
either to seize the youth or to use his weapon
against him.</p>
<p>Avon concluded that the only course which
offered hope was to allow the warrior to
approach slightly closer, and then to wheel
and let him have several chambers from his
Winchester.</p>
<p>He would have to act quickly, but he had
already proven himself capable of that, and it
might be that the Comanche would be looking
for something of the kind, and was supple
enough to secure the drop on him. His
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
people were accustomed to border warfare and
had graduated in all the subtlety of the fearful
business.</p>
<p>Young Burnet had fixed his course of action
in his mind when, to his consternation, he
heard the sounds of approaching hoofs over
the prairie!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>THE FRIEND IN NEED.</h3>
</div>
<p>If horsemen were thundering toward the
spot, the fugitive was doomed.</p>
<p>But, though seized with despair, he did not
yield. On the contrary, he was nerved to
such desperation that he put forth a tremendous
effort, which quickly increased the space
between him and the pursuer.</p>
<p>But instead of heading away from the coming
animals, he turned directly toward them,
at the same astonishing velocity. Why he
did this, he himself did not fully understand.
It may have been that, impressed with the
utter uselessness of trying to escape by running,
he had a blind hope of unhorsing one of
his enemies and wrenching his steed from
him.</p>
<p>He had taken only a few leaps, however,
when he discovered that the beasts running
forward, as if to meet him, were cattle.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>Fully fifty animals, belonging to the herd
several miles distant, had started out on a
little stampede of their own, and fate brought
them and him in collision.</p>
<p>It mattered not, for nothing could make
the situation worse. The next instant Avon
was among them, in imminent risk of being
trampled to death. The beasts were terrified
by the advent of the footman, and scattered in
the wildest confusion.</p>
<p>While he was in such deadly peril, the
animals served as a shield against the assault
of the Comanche close behind him. Anxious
as he was to secure the fugitive, he was not
prepared to &ldquo;cut him out&rdquo; from a drove of
stampeded cattle.</p>
<p>He turned to avoid the terrific rush, and
catching fitful glimpses of the leaping form
among the beasts, raised his gun and let fly.</p>
<p>His shot struck, but, instead of bringing
down the youth, it tumbled one of the
bullocks headlong on the plain. Avon would
have turned at once to give attention to his
enemy, had he not been fully occupied in saving
himself from the animals themselves.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>Fortunately he had not penetrated far
among the drove, and, by a continuance of his
inimitable dexterity, he dodged from among
them, helped thereto by the efforts of the
cattle themselves to flee from the terrifying
object.</p>
<p>It was at this juncture, when the youth was
striving to get sight of his enemy, who, he
believed, was trying equally hard to secure
another shot at him, that he saw the very
thing he had been dreading from the first.</p>
<p>It was a single horseman, who almost rode
him down ere he could check his steed. Avon
was so flurried from his fierce exertions, that,
before he could bring his rifle to his shoulder
and discharge it, the other anticipated him.</p>
<p>But the man did not fire at <i>him</i>. He aimed
at the Comanche, not a dozen yards distant,
and hit him fairly and squarely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helloa, Baby, what the mischief is up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven, Ballyhoo, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;
exclaimed the panting youth, ready to drop
from exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ballyhoo,&rdquo; was the nickname of Oscar
Gleeson, one of the cowboys in charge of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
two thousand cattle that were to start northward
on the morrow over the Great Cattle
Trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby&rdquo; was the name by which Avon
Burnet was known among the rest, because
of his youth.</p>
<p>Leaning over his horse, the tall Texan
reached down and grasped the hand of his
young friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sort of looks, Baby, as though I had
arrived in time to do you a little turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt of that, for I couldn&rsquo;t
have run much further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you run at all? I observed
but one Injin, and he&rsquo;s of no further account
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I started there were four after me,
but I threw all out of sight except one. I was
on the point of turning to fight him, when I
heard the cattle, and thought they were other
Comanches coming to the help of this fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But things seem to be in a queer shape at
the house; tell me the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how did you know anything about
it at all?&rdquo; asked the surprised Avon.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been down there and seen things for
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me hear about that first, then I&rsquo;ll let
you know what I have to tell, and it is
important indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Texan, in obedience to his training, cast
a look after the vanishing herd and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a big job to round them up, but I
guess we&rsquo;ll have to leave &rsquo;em alone for a time.
Wal, you know we went into camp a few miles
to the north, to wait for you and the captain
that was to jine us in the morning. We were
looking after things, when I remembered that
I had left my package of tobacco at the house.
Things were so quiet, and I was so afeared
that you and the captain would forgit to bring
it with you, that I concluded to ride over after
it myself. I never dreamed of any of the varmints
being there, and was going along at a
swinging gait, when I heard the sound of a
gun and I fetched up my horse to learn what
it meant. I didn&rsquo;t see an Injin, but while I
was looking somebody made a rush from the
front of the house for the bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was myself,&rdquo; interrupted Avon excitedly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
&ldquo;and the captain fired to save me and
did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that was Ballyhoo Gleeson that
let loose that partic&rsquo;lar shot,&rdquo; said the cowboy
with a chuckle; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know who it
was running, but thought it was one of the
varmints. Just afore that I was sure that I
seed one of &rsquo;em and I let fly, shootin&rsquo; on
gineral principles as you might say. I
might have investigated things, but the Comanches
were too numerous for comfort, and
I wheeled about and made off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was you who fired the shot that
really cleared the way for me,&rdquo; said the astonished
youth; &ldquo;I supposed, all the time,
that it was my uncle. Where have you been
since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started for camp to tell the boys, and
was on my way when I met these confounded
cattle. I didn&rsquo;t want them to get too fur off,
as none of the fellows &rsquo;peared to be after them.
I was trying to round them up, when this
little affair took place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Ballyhoo, why didn&rsquo;t you let the
cattle go and make all haste after help.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The folks in the house; do you suppose I
would have ventured out as I did, if they were
not in instant need of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently the Texan found it hard to understand
the extremity of Captain Shirril and his
family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three of &rsquo;em there and each has
a gun; I don&rsquo;t see why you need worry, &rsquo;cause
the varmints can&rsquo;t get at &rsquo;em and they&rsquo;ll clear
out in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be, but uncle says they will
set fire to the cabin, unless they are driven
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of <i>that</i>,&rdquo; replied Gleeson,
who still could not feel the alarm of his young
friend; &ldquo;the cabin has been purty well dried
up by the drought of the last few months. I
thought the varmints were after the cattle,
and,&rdquo; he added, again peering through the
gloom after the herd, which had run so far
that they were not only out of sight but beyond
hearing, &ldquo;they stand a show of making
a good haul. But,&rdquo; he continued more
savagely, &ldquo;they will find a little trouble in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
getting off with them. There&rsquo;s too many for
us to lose without a big fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference if the whole
herd is stampeded, we must hurry to the aid
of the folks in the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being as them sentiments are the captain&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
said Ballyhoo, &ldquo;why, I&rsquo;m agreeable
to doing as him and you wish. So jump up
here behind me, and we&rsquo;ll go to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up with you!&rdquo; commanded the Texan.
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if some more of the varmints
will be on hand afore long, to attend the
obsequies of their champion runner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avon obeyed, and the laden mustang struck
off to the northward, at an easy gait.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>VANISHED.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was a startling sight, when Captain Shirril,
stretched at full length on the roof of
his cabin, gazed in front of him and saw the
head and shoulders of a Comanche Indian
slowly rise to view at the corner of the eaves.</p>
<p>He could not doubt its meaning: the assailants
were bent on burning the structure,
and were willing to face the danger that was
sure to meet them in making the attempt.</p>
<p>Even in this exciting moment, the Texan
could not help asking himself the question
which he had asked many times before: why
did not the redskins set fire to the side of the
house, where they were involved in no such
peril as now? They might have gathered
several armfuls of combustibles, and, heaping
them against the wooden walls, fire them at
their leisure, but, for some reason, they preferred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
to climb upon the roof, and run the risk
of colliding with the courageous Dinah or her
fearless master.</p>
<p>In doing as they did, the Comanches were
shrewder than would be supposed. It is true
that the narrow windows commanded only
one side of the cabin, and that the attempt
spoken of brought little if any danger to
themselves. In fact, as afterward was
learned, they did their best to set fire to the
rear, and at the end, but the timber was so
damp that the flames failed to communicate.
The long continued drought affected the walls
to a far less degree than the roof, where the
sun had free play day after day. Had there
been a driving storm, the top would have
been less favorable than the walls, but from
the causes named it lost its moisture much
more readily.</p>
<p>Besides, the flames on the roof could not be
reached as readily nor with so much safety
by the defenders as at the sides. They
naturally believed there was plenty of water
at command. The moment the fire should
begin to show through the crevices in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
timbers, this could be dashed against the
other side and brought into play.</p>
<p>It was different on the roof, which could
not be reached so well. There may have been
other motives influencing the Comanches in
the first instance, such as supposing that the
whites, having once repulsed the attempt,
would not look for its repetition, since the
Indians must expose themselves to the
greatest possible peril.</p>
<p>However, without speculating as to their
reasons, the fact remained that a second
Indian was rising like an apparition above
the eaves, with the evident intention of trying
to repair the failure of his companion a short
time before.</p>
<p>Captain Shirril felt that it would have been
better had he stayed where he was; for, with
his head just above the level of the scuttle,
he could have picked off the wretch the very
moment he became aware of his presence.</p>
<p>But now, while creeping so guardedly along
the roof, he had held his rifle by the barrel,
with most of the weapon behind him. Had it
been discharged, in that position, it was he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
who would have received the bullet, instead
of the Indian.</p>
<p>To make the gun effective, he must bring it
around in front and sight it. While his own
form pressed the planking so close that the
savage apparently failed to identify him,
though carefully scanning the surface, there
was a strong probability that he would detect
the meaning of the slight noise involved in
the act.</p>
<p>The Texan dared not advance nor retreat,
though he would have preferred to withdraw
through the opening; but the moment he
made sure of what confronted him, he began
bringing his gun forward, with the resolve to
fire the moment he could draw a bead on the
miscreant.</p>
<p>The weapon advanced like the minute-hand
over the face of a clock. Knowing the stake
for which he was working, he did not neglect
any precaution that could bring success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can duck his head quickly enough,&rdquo;
thought the captain, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll pick him off
the instant there is reason to believe he scents
mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>His intention, in such an event, was to
bring his Winchester to the right position and
discharge it with the utmost celerity. His
experience in the Civil War and in Texas
rendered him an adept at this business, but,
on the other hand, it will be seen that the precautions
of the Comanche himself could be
executed in a twinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound the luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Shirril had almost reached the
decisive point, when the head of the redskin
vanished!</p>
<p>Whether or not he saw his danger cannot
be said, but it is probable that the slight noise
of the arm and gun struck his ear and decided
him to drop out of sight until an investigation
should be made.</p>
<p>The Texan was exasperated, for he was
eager to bring down this scamp, and, up to
the moment of his disappearance, was confident
of doing so, but the opportunity was gone.</p>
<p>Instead of retreating to cover again, he decided
to remain on the roof a brief while
longer; but he stealthily shifted his position
a little nearer the edge of the building. Now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
that he was at liberty for the moment, he laid
aside his gun and drew his revolver. That
was the weapon for such an emergency, and
he kept it in position for instant use, without
the fatal preliminaries that had just defeated
his purpose.</p>
<p>The captain clung to the belief that, despite
the second repulse of the Comanches, they
would persist in their attempt until it should
prove too costly to them.</p>
<p>But he was not shortsighted enough to believe
the repetition would be in the precise
fashion of the last: that is to say, he did not
suspect the Indian, after ducking so promptly
out of range, would pop up his head again to
invite a shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will appear at some other corner,&rdquo;
was his conclusion, &ldquo;which they believe is
unguarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes had become so accustomed to the
gloom that he could trace the outlines of the
eaves around the cabin, and he felt little fear,
therefore, of his enemies stealing upon him unawares.
They might try it, but he was confident
of defeating their purpose at the very onset.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>Another fear troubled him: having learned
that he was on the roof, they were likely to
begin firing at it from a distance, raking the
entire surface so effectively that some of the
bullets were quite sure to find him. Prudence
whispered to him to withdraw into the
interior of the cabin while the chance was his,
but there was a stubborn streak in the Texan&rsquo;s
composition which caused him to hold his
place. He had been under fire so often that it
seemed as if nothing could disturb his coolness
or ruffle his presence of mind, and he was
so inured to personal peril that he felt something
of the old thrill of which he had spoken
earlier in the evening, when recalling his experience
in the war that had closed only a few
years before.</p>
<p>But none of the expected shots came. He
heard the sound of more than one mustang&rsquo;s
hoofs, and several signals between the warriors,
but no one sent a bullet skimming along
the slope on which he lay looking and listening,
and on the alert for the first appearance
of his assailants.</p>
<p>This led him to suspect that, after all, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
were not certain of his presence. It was
sound and not sight that had caused the sudden
withdrawal of the warrior.</p>
<p>If this were the case, there was a greater
probability of his showing up again.</p>
<p>It is at such times that the minutes seem to
have ten-fold their real length. The Texan,
after glancing closely along the rim of the
roof, not forgetting to take a peep over the
peak, turned his gaze to the northward, and
listened for the sounds that were so long in
coming. Not the glimmer of a light showed
in that direction, nor could he catch the faintest
sound of a galloping hoof, other than such
as was made by the mustangs of the Comanches
near the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avon ought to have arrived before this,
and the boys would not throw away a second
after learning the truth from him. He may
have been hindered, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='CHAPTER_XVI_CLEVERLY_DONE' id='CHAPTER_XVI_CLEVERLY_DONE'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>CLEVERLY DONE.</h3>
</div>
<p>At this moment the Texan heard something.</p>
<p>The noise could not have been any more
distinct than that which had apprised the
Comanche of his peril just in time to save
himself. It was so faint, indeed, that it was
not until he had listened a few seconds longer
that he could decide the precise point whence
it came.</p>
<p>It was at the same end of the cabin, but on
the corner opposite to that where he had
detected the warrior. The captain, therefore,
was forced to peep over the edge of the peak,
in order to hold his gaze on the point. This
was easy enough, and, as he stealthily peered
through the gloom, he levelled his weapon, in
whose use he was as skilful as that of the
Winchester.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>He had decided in his mind the precise
point where the head of the Indian would rise
to view, and he was resolved not to throw
away his chance this time. The moment he
could make sure of his target, he would perforate
it with several bullets, in order to prevent
any possible mistake.</p>
<p>But, though the sound was repeated, the
object itself failed to materialize. It was
there, but he could not see it clearly enough
to risk a shot.</p>
<p>Strange that, with all the Texan&rsquo;s experience,
this fact did not lead him to suspect
the real cause of the warrior&rsquo;s continued
absence!</p>
<p>But at the moment he began speculating, he
became convinced that his enemy was moving.
He was there and had betrayed himself.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the extreme difficulty of
seeing an object distinctly when the light is
poor, and we concentrate our gaze upon it.
That which is clear at first grows dim and perhaps
vanishes altogether from sight.</p>
<p>Something of the kind is noticeable when we
try to count the seven stars of the Pleiades.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
It is easy enough to fix upon six, but if we
gaze too intently, the seventh modestly withdraws
from view.</p>
<p>This was the case for a minute or two with
Captain Shirril. The first glance at the suspicious
point showed him the outlines of a
head, but while gazing at it, he began to doubt
whether it was there at all. Aware of the
peculiarity named, he turned his eyes toward
a spot several feet removed, and then glanced
back to the original point.</p>
<p>The Comanche was there!</p>
<p>The Texan sighted his pistol as best he could
in the obscurity, but, while doing so with all
care, the target began to grow dim, until he
was afraid that, if he pressed the trigger, a
miss would result, and surely he could not
afford that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait,&rdquo; was his decision; &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t
know that I&rsquo;m on the watch, and there will be
more of him in sight before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was remarkable indeed that the sagacious
captain still failed to suspect the object of this
strange proceeding.</p>
<p>There came the moment when there was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
cause for longer delay. The shoulders were in
sight, and the skilful marksman was certain
of bringing the warrior down with his first
bullet.</p>
<p>But at the moment of firing, he was restrained
by a strange suspicion, or rather a
strange occurrence.</p>
<p>The head of the Comanche made an abrupt
flirt to one side&ndash;&ndash;then straightened up, flopped
still more in the other direction, and then
became upright again.</p>
<p>This was not only extraordinary, but it was
something which a genuine Indian would
never do, whether he belonged to the Comanche
or some other tribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s your game, is it?&rdquo; muttered
the Texan, catching on to the truth.</p>
<p>The cunning red men were making use of a
dummy instead of one of their own number,
and, astounding as the statement may seem,
this dummy was the very warrior that had
fallen by the shot of Oscar Gleeson.</p>
<p>Instead of trusting the success of their
scheme to an image made by mounting a
blanket over the end of a stick, and which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
might well deceive where there was so little
light, they had picked up the inanimate body,
lifted it upon the back of one of their mustangs,
and slowly elevated it above the eaves,
imitating the natural action as closely as they
could.</p>
<p>However, they ought to have practiced the
trick before risking so much on its success.
Everything was going right, until the head
reached a point where it was not advisable
to support it further, since the hands thus
employed were likely to receive some of the
bullets they expected to be fired after it.</p>
<p>The withdrawal of the support caused it to
tip to one side, and the too prompt effort to
retrieve the mistake sent it in the opposite
direction. This mishap was quickly repaired,
but not until the deception had become manifest
to the watchful Texan, who smiled
grimly, without suspecting the deeper meaning
of the performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I will throw away any shots
on <i>you</i>&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;for there will
be plenty of other chances where more good
may be done.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></div>
<p>A thoughtful man might have concluded
that the Comanches were taking a good deal
of unnecessary pains. Suppose the white
man did send several bullets into the dummy,
there was no hope of his exhausting his supply
or of the Comanche finding him wholly
unprepared.</p>
<p>They probably believed that, after such a
discharge on his part, he would not expect an
instant renewal of the attempt, and would,
therefore, be off his guard for a few seconds,
during which they could make their rush.</p>
<p>This was drawing it exceedingly fine, and
the Texan did not attempt to explain that
which must always remain a partial mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder now whether that can be a
little plan to hold my attention, while they
try something in another direction,&rdquo; was his
next thought, which proved that Captain
Shirril was at last approaching the right trail.</p>
<p>The image, or rather body, having been
raised far enough above the eaves to show the
head and shoulders, remained as stationary as
if carved in wood. It was unsafe for its projectors
to trust it further without support. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
was now ready to receive the fire of the gentleman,
and the Comanches might well ask why
it was he delayed opening business.</p>
<p>He kept it under scrutiny a few seconds
longer, fearful that there might be some
hidden design which he did not understand;
and then, in obedience to his suspicion, he
turned his head to look over the roof behind
him.</p>
<p>At the moment of doing so, he heard a
stealthy but rapid step. The first glance
showed him a sinewy warrior, moving softly
across the planking from the other end of the
cabin and coming directly toward him.</p>
<p>The Comanche was in a crouching posture,
with his rifle in his left hand, while his right
rested on his hip, as if grasping the handle of
his knife.</p>
<p>Supposing the dusky foe was coming for
him, Captain <a name='TC_3'></a><ins class="tnchg" title="Was 'Shirrill' in original text">Shirril</ins> rose to a half-sitting
position, and held his revolver ready. He
meant to wait until his enemy was so near
that there could be no possibility of missing
him.</p>
<p>Before that point was reached, the Comanche
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
would have to pass directly by the
open scuttle. The Texan awaited his coming
with the same coolness he had shown from the
first, when to his inexpressible amazement the
Indian dropped directly through the open
door and drew it shut after him, with a
suddenness like that of the snapping of a
knife-blade.</p>
<p>And then it was that Captain Shirril read
the meaning of that strange man&oelig;uvring at
the corner of the roof, and awoke to the fact
that he had been completely outwitted.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='CHAPTER_XVII_AT_FAULT' id='CHAPTER_XVII_AT_FAULT'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>AT FAULT.</h3>
</div>
<p>Captain Shirril was never so outwitted
in all his life. With never a suspicion
that the Comanche, dashing over the roof, had
any other purpose than to assail him, he was
holding his revolver pointed, reflecting at the
same time on the blind folly of the red man in
rushing to his fate, when he dropped through
the scuttle and closed it after him.</p>
<p>With a muttered exclamation of chagrin
the Texan leaped to his feet, reaching the spot
in a couple of bounds, and let fly with two
chambers of his weapon. The bullets skimmed
over the door, the inimitable dexterity of the
Indian saving him as by a hair&rsquo;s breadth.</p>
<p>Thus the fellow had entered the cabin after
all, by a piece of strategy as brilliant as it was
daring, and the only man who was a defender
of the place found himself shut out and a
prisoner, as may be said, on the roof.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>Unwilling to believe the astounding logic of
facts, the captain stooped down and tried to
lift the door; but it had been placed there
with the view of being raised only from below.
It was impossible to get anything but the
slightest hold upon it, and when he tried to
lift it upward, it could not be moved.</p>
<p>The Comanche was either holding it, or had
fastened it in place by means of the iron
hook.</p>
<p>Thinking only of the safety of his wife and
servant, the Texan bent over, and, putting his
mouth as close to the edge as he could,
shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out down there, Edna! There&rsquo;s an
Indian on the upper floor, and I am fastened
on the roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Provided his wife heard the warning, this
particular Comanche was liable, after all, to
find that, in undertaking his contract, he
would be unable to deliver the goods. But, if
the warning reached the ears of the women,
would they comprehend its significance?
<i>That</i> was the question which must soon be
answered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>The meaning of the peculiar strategy of the
Comanches was now fully understood by the
victim. With a humiliation beyond description,
he comprehended how he had fallen into
the trap that had been set so cunningly for
his feet.</p>
<p>All this trifling at one corner of the roof
was intended to hold his attention, while one
of the warriors stealthily climbed over the
eaves at another portion and reached the inside
by dropping through the scuttle.</p>
<p>The plan, simple as it might seem, had
worked to perfection.</p>
<p>The moment the captain comprehended that
he was shut out as effectually as the miscreant
was shut in, he glared around in quest of
others who might be trying to work his own
death by a continuation of their cunning.
Aware, too, of his exposure to their shots, he
quickly sank on his face, with his head nigh
enough to the peak to hold the entire surface
under his eye.</p>
<p>It was well he did so; for from the same
corner that the successful Indian had come,
he discerned a second climbing over the eaves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
He was doing so with an eagerness that
showed he was discounting his own chances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether you are bogus or not, here
goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Texan did not rely upon his revolver to
serve him in the crisis, but hastily aiming his
Winchester, pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>The Comanche, whose body was half over
the roof, threw up his arms with a wild
screech and disappeared backward, as
abruptly as his companion had gone down
the scuttle. There could be no doubt of
the success of <i>that</i> shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to have a few more of you
try it,&rdquo; muttered the defender, compressing
his lips and glancing right and left. His
blood was up and he was in a desperate
mood.</p>
<p>But his own situation was one of extreme
peril. The Comanches must be aware of his
singular dilemma, and were not likely to leave
him undisputed master of the situation, at
least as long as he remained on the outside.</p>
<p>That this supposition was right was proven
the next minute, when, from a point several
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
rods distant, a gun was fired and the bullet
skipped over the surface within a few inches
of where he was crouching. A second shot
followed still closer, and the captain crept a
little farther from the scuttle.</p>
<p>But for fear of alarming his friends below,
he would have uttered a cry, as if of pain, with
a view of convincing the Comanches that their
shots had proven fatal. Then they would be
tempted to send more of their number over
the roof, where they would fall victims to
his marksmanship.</p>
<p>It looked as if the assailants were in doubt
on this point, for after the two shots they
ceased firing, and everything remained silent
for several minutes.</p>
<p>Captain Shirril, even in his anxiety for
himself, could not forget the inmates of his
home. Two women and a fierce warrior were
inside, and matters were sure to become lively
there before long.</p>
<p>In the midst of this oppressive stillness,
occurred Avon Burnet&rsquo;s adventure which has
been told elsewhere. It was impossible for
the captain to understand what the confusion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
on the prairie meant, but he saw that it was a
diversion of some kind which, fortunately for
himself, held the attention of his enemies for
a while longer.</p>
<p>He felt a vague suspicion that the Indian in
the room below would try to get a shot at him
through the scuttle door. He could raise it
for an inch or more, and, provided the white
man was in his line of range, fire with quick
and unerring accuracy. It is singular that he
did not do this in the first place, after reaching
the roof, and before the Texan discovered
his presence so near him.</p>
<p>Lying extended as flat as before, Captain
Shirril placed his ear close to the door and
listened.</p>
<p>Within the first minute he caught a sound,
but it was so faint and indefinite that he could
not tell what it meant. It might have been
caused by someone moving about in the
room directly below, but he was inclined to
believe that the Comanche was still near the
scuttle and was trying to get his range.</p>
<p>All at once the heart of the Texan gave a
start. He was sure the door was pushed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
upward the slightest possible distance. It
looked as if the Comanche was endeavoring to
do the very thing suspected&ndash;&ndash;that is, he was
seeking to gain sight of the white man in
order to give him a stealthy shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he will but raise that door a single
inch,&rdquo; was the exultant thought of the captain,
&ldquo;I will get my fingers under the edge
and yank it back in spite of all he can do,
and just about that time the band will begin
to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But would the Indian be rash enough to do
this? The first glimpse through the slightest
crevice would tell him that his intended victim
had shifted his position. He would be
shrewd enough to suspect its meaning, and
would take care that he did not throw away
the golden opportunity he had so brilliantly
won.</p>
<p>Ah, if his wife and Dinah could but learn
the exact truth! They would quickly prove
potent factors in the scheme. Their familiarity
with the house would enable them to
eliminate that wretch who just then seemed
to be master of the situation.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>Yes; the door moved again. The Indian
must be beneath, and was striving to do something
with the covering, which at present
shielded him from the vengeance of the white
man whom he had foiled.</p>
<p>The latter silently extended his hand to the
edge of the door, hoping that the purchase
for which he was waiting was within reach.
He was disappointed. If the structure had
been moved, it was to such a slight extent as
to afford no advantage.</p>
<p>He held his hand in the same position,
intent on seizing the chance the instant it presented
itself, but the Indian was wonderfully
cunning. It would seem that having introduced
himself into the ranchman&rsquo;s home, he
would have been content to follow the purpose
that had taken him thither, without
giving more attention to the white man, whom
he had certainly spared for the time, when he
was in his power. The captain could not
understand the logic which appeared to be
controlling this warrior from the moment he
climbed over the edge of the roof.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>AN UNEXPECTED QUERY.</h3>
</div>
<p>As long as Captain Shirril stayed near the
scuttle, he could not command a view
of the entire roof of his cabin. His interest in
what was going on below made him anxious
to do this, but he was too alive to his own
danger to remain motionless for more than a
few minutes at a time.</p>
<p>The indistinct rustling that had awakened
his hope soon ceased, and he was compelled to
believe the Comanche had given up his intention
of trying to gain a stealthy shot at him
and was now devoting himself to the inmates
of the dwelling.</p>
<p>How he longed to descend through the
scuttle and take part in the stirring events
that must soon be under way there! What
short work he would make of the wretch who
had dared to assume such a risk!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>But it was useless to regret his own shortsightedness,
now that it rendered him powerless
to strike a blow for his friends. He crept
to the peak of the roof, and scrutinized every
portion thus brought into his field of vision.
Not the slightest sound fell upon his ear that
could indicate danger, nor could he discern
anything of his enemies.</p>
<p>The wind was still blowing fitfully, and he
heard the familiar rustle of the mesquite bush,
with now and then a signal passing between
the Comanches. He listened in vain for the
noise made by the hoofs of their mustangs.
They seemed to have ceased their aimless
galloping back and forth, and were probably
plotting some new form of mischief.</p>
<p>Suddenly the rattle of a horse&rsquo;s feet struck
him. It broke upon his hearing for an
instant, and then ceased as abruptly as it had
made itself manifest.</p>
<p>It was as if a steed were galloping over the
soft earth, and, reaching a small bridge of
planks, dashed over them with two or three
bounds, his hoofs immediately becoming inaudible
in the yielding ground beyond.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>That which might have puzzled a listener
was plain to the Texan, who had spent many
years on the plains of the Southwest. He
knew that what might be called a peculiar
eddy in the fitful wind had brought the sound
to him. A sudden change of direction&ndash;&ndash;ended
as soon as it began&ndash;&ndash;whirled the noise as
straight across the intervening space as if it
had been fired by an arrow.</p>
<p>The sound was similar to that which he
had noticed many times that evening, but the
impression came to him that it possessed a
significance which belonged to none of the
others. It was a single horse, and he was
going at a moderate speed, which, however,
was the case with most of those he had heard.</p>
<p>All at once the sound broke upon his ear
again, but this time it was accompanied by
the noise of many other hoofs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are cattle,&rdquo; was his conclusion;
&ldquo;a part of the herd has been stampeded, and
one of the men is trying to round them up: it
was his mustang that I heard&ndash;&ndash;ah! there it
goes again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the crack of a rifle and the screech
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
of a mortally struck person that startled him
this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that was a Comanche who has
gone down before the rifle of one of our men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the reader is aware, the Texan was
correct in every particular, for it was the
report of Gleeson&rsquo;s Winchester, which ended
the career of the warrior pressing Avon Burnet
so hard, that reached the captain as he lay
on the roof of his own dwelling.</p>
<p>The whimsical nature of the wind, that had
been blowing all the night, excluded further
sounds. The stillness that succeeded seemed
so unnatural in its way that it might have
alarmed a more superstitious person. Once
the faintest possible rumbling of the cattle&rsquo;s
hoofs was detected, but it quickly subsided,
and nothing more of the kind was noticeable.</p>
<p>It was clear that the Comanches in the immediate
vicinity of the cabin must have noted
all that interested the Texan. Whatever the
issue of the remarkable meeting on the
prairie, there could be no doubt that one of
the red men had been laid low. Another had
been shot by the captain a short time before,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
not to mention the other one or two that he
believed had fallen.</p>
<p>Thus far, no one of the inmates had been
harmed, unless perchance his nephew was
overtaken by disaster. Consequently, the
game the Comanches were playing, though
they did their part with rare skill, was a
losing one up to this point.</p>
<p>As the minutes passed, the Texan found
himself more hopeful than he had been
through the entire evening. He was strong in
the belief that Avon had succeeded in reaching
the camp of the cattlemen, and that the
latter would soon appear on the scene with an
emphasis that would scatter his assailants
like so much chaff.</p>
<p>The only vulnerable point for fire was on
the roof, but the designs of the Indians had
been defeated thus far, and he believed they
could be stood off indefinitely, at least until
the arrival of the cowboys, who would then
take charge of business.</p>
<p>The two matters that gave him anxiety
were the presence of the warrior below in the
cabin, and the probability of himself being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
struck by some of the bullets that he expected
to come scurrying over the planking
every minute.</p>
<p>The two shots that had been fired came
alarmingly near, and the next were likely to
come still nearer.</p>
<p>But immunity from harm gives one confidence,
and only a few more minutes passed
when, instead of contenting himself with peering
about him, the captain began stealthily
creeping toward the part of the eaves where
the last Indian had appeared and disappeared
so suddenly.</p>
<p>Mindful of the risk of the action, he paused
when close to the edge, and waited several
minutes before venturing to peep over. The
stillness was as if every living person were a
hundred miles away. This, however, as he
well knew, might be the case with a score of
Indians grouped directly beneath.</p>
<p>But having gone thus far, he did not mean
to return to his post without accomplishing
something. With the greatest possible caution,
he raised his head just far enough to
look over. He held it in this position only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
a second or two, for, if any of his enemies
were on the alert, they would be sure to
observe him.</p>
<p>Nothing greeted his vision, beyond that
which he had seen times without number. He
did not catch the outlines of a single person
or mustang, though convinced they were near
at hand.</p>
<p>Had there been any doubt on this point, it
would have been dissipated by a repetition of
the signals that seemed almost continually
passing between the besieging Comanches.</p>
<p>Captain Shirril noticed that the sounds
came from the direction of the mesquite bush,
as though most of them had gathered there
apparently for consultation, and were calling
in the other members of their party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is so, they can&rsquo;t do us much harm,&rdquo;
was his conclusion, &ldquo;but they are not likely to
stay there. I suppose they have gathered in
Avon and my horses long ago, and we shall
have to ride other animals on the tramp to
Kansas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the whole, the result of his survey was
satisfactory; whatever mischief the Comanches
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
were plotting, there was no immediate
danger. Minutes were precious, but they were
more valuable to the defenders than to the assailants.
The cattlemen must arrive soon, and
when they did so the siege would be over.</p>
<p>The reconnoissance, if such it may be
termed, lasted but a few minutes, when the
captain started on his cautious return to the
scuttle, in the hope that something in the way
of information awaited him there.</p>
<p>To his amazement, he was still within several
yards, when he perceived that it was open.</p>
<p>The door was raised fully six inches, the
opening being toward him, so that the Comanche
had him at his mercy. It looked indeed
to the Texan as if his enemy had got the
drop on him, and at last he was at his mercy.</p>
<p>The captain whipped out his revolver, but
before he could fire a familiar voice called out
in a husky undertone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am dat you, captin&rsquo;? And am you well?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>DOWN THE LADDER.</h3>
</div>
<p>The colored servant Dinah never knew how
near she came to being shot by her own
master. Had she delayed speaking for a
second, he would have discharged two more
chambers of his revolver, and the distance was
so slight, and her head was in such position,
that there could have been no miss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; gasped the captain, &ldquo;I
never dreamed that was you, Dinah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I knowed it war <i>you</i>. How is you
gettin&rsquo; &rsquo;long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, but where is your mistress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Downsta&rsquo;rs tending to tings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;but do you know there&rsquo;s an Indian
in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckons so; we didn&rsquo;t know it at fust,
but we found it out putty soon after he
arrove; why didn&rsquo;t you told us?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to do so, but was afraid you
wouldn&rsquo;t hear my voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We heerd you say somefin, but couldn&rsquo;t
quite make out what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of the Indian?&rdquo; asked the
captain, who was now at the scuttle with
his hand on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He am all right; and if you don&rsquo;t
t&rsquo;ink so, jes&rsquo; come down and see for you&rsquo;self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinah stepped out of the way, and her
master lost no time in descending through the
opening into the dark room below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fasten the door, for there may be more of
them trying to enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doesn&rsquo;t t&rsquo;ink so,&rdquo; was the confident
reply.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Dinah reached up and fastened
the hook in place, making it as secure as
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your mistress safe?&rdquo; asked Captain
Shirril, the moment he was within the apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I jes&rsquo; tole you she was? Does
you t&rsquo;ink I would try to deceibe you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me how it is; this strikes me as
the strangest part of the whole business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing thus, in the stillness and gloom of
the upper room, the servant related in her
characteristic way the extraordinary experience
of herself and mistress with the dusky
intruder.</p>
<p>As she had said, the warning which the
captain shouted from the roof was heard
by them, but the words were not understood.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shirril, however, was keen-witted
enough to suspect the truth. The muffled
tones showed that her husband was on the
roof, while the noise of the body dropping
upon the chair proved that someone had
entered by that means. That being the case,
the stranger of necessity must be a foe,
against whose evil intentions they must prepare
themselves without delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the Indians has dropped through
the scuttle,&rdquo; said the startled lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anoder ob dem warmints has comed into
my room, eh?&rdquo; muttered the angered servant;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sarve him wuss dan the oder one.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You will not find the task so easy; keep
at my side, make no noise, and don&rsquo;t stir till
I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time, the embers on the hearth
were so low that they gave out only a faint
illumination, which extended but a foot or
two into the room. The women had kept
their places near the door, where, as will be
remembered, they noticed a pressure, as if
someone was trying to shove it open.</p>
<p>Light-footed as was the Comanche, his
weight was too great, and his descent too
sudden, for him to keep the knowledge from
the women below-stairs. They stepped softly
away from the door, and into the denser
gloom, where they were unable to see each
other, although their persons touched. In
this attitude, they could do nothing for a time
but listen with rapidly beating hearts.</p>
<p>The dusky intruder dropped so squarely on
the chair that it did not overturn. He kept
his place, instantly securing the scuttle
against the entrance of the white man, whom
he had baffled with such cleverness. Probably
he had some idea of taking a shot at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
him, but the little man&oelig;uvring in which he
indulged told him the danger was too great,
and he gave over the purpose.</p>
<p>The stillness in the room was so profound
that the women plainly heard his moccasins
touch the floor, when he stepped from the
chair. Then he began gliding softly about
the apartment, like a burglar who is obliged
to feel every inch of his way with hands and
feet.</p>
<p>Great as was his care, he had not continued
this long, when he struck the chair and overturned
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;De willian!&rdquo; muttered Dinah, &ldquo;and dat&rsquo;s
in my abpartment too&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; whispered her mistress, touching
her arm, &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t do any harm, and he
must not hear us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Mrs. Shirril given permission, the servant
would have hurried up the ladder and
taken the fellow to task, without a moment&rsquo;s
delay or hesitation.</p>
<p>But the Comanche was better prepared for
his work than they suspected. They plainly
heard him scratch a match on the wall of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
the room, and the next moment the faintest
possible glow showed through the gloom,
above the open door at the head of the ladder.
The redskin was taking the only effectual
means at his command to learn his bearings.</p>
<p>With the tiny light still burning, he passed
quickly from one room to another, his location
being easily told by the listeners below.
It took him less than a minute to gain the
knowledge he wished, when the match burned
out and was flung aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder wheder he&rsquo;ll set fiah&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sharp pinch on Dinah&rsquo;s arm warned her
that she was displeasing her mistress, and she
closed her mouth.</p>
<p>The Comanche was too wise to attempt to
go down the ladder with a burning match in
his hand. Had he done so, he would have
committed the fatal error of the citizen who
awakes in the night and sets out with lighted
lamp to hunt for a burglar: all the advantage
is on the side of the law-breaker.</p>
<p>But the Indian had seen the ladder leading
from the second story to the lower floor, and
the women were sure he would pay them a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
visit. Indeed, his errand would be futile unless
he did so, for it was not to be supposed
that he had come into the cabin through
simple curiosity.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shirril had no fear of his trying to
burn the structure, for, if he did so, his own
situation would be as hopeless as theirs. The
sounds of firing and the noise on the roof,
which soon reached her ears, caused great uneasiness
for her husband, but, like a pioneer&rsquo;s
wife, she gave her whole attention to the peril
that confronted her.</p>
<p>Suddenly the servant touched her arm.
She did not speak, but her mistress knew the
meaning of the act. The Comanche had
placed his foot on the upper round of the
ladder and was about to descend to the lower
apartments, where they were awaiting him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him to me,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Shirril;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t stir or do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cunning warrior knew the women were
below, and he knew, too, that unless he used
extreme caution, he would find himself in a
veritable hornet&rsquo;s nest. The care with which
he placed his moccasins on the rounds, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
gradually came down, proved this, but the
hearing of the women was attuned to so fine
an edge that they traced his descent step by
step until he stood on the lower floor.</p>
<p>Having arrived there, he paused for a
minute or two, as if in doubt what next to do.
Evidently he was listening in the hope that
the women would betray their presence by
some movement, but in this he was mistaken.</p>
<p>During those brief moments, Mrs. Shirril
was on the point, more than once, of bringing
her rifle to her shoulder and shooting down
the wretch who was seeking their lives; but
accustomed as she was to the rough experience
of the frontier, she could not nerve herself
to the point of doing so. She knew the
precise spot where he was standing, and, at
the first direct approach, she would shoot him
as if he was a rabid dog. But so long as he
was motionless, she refrained.</p>
<p>What the Comanche would have done at the
end of a few minutes it is impossible to say,
had not an interruption, as surprising as it
was unexpected by all parties, taken place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>&ldquo;THE BOYS HAVE ARRIVED!&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<p>The embers on the hearth had smouldered
so low that they were mere points of
light that served to make the gloom deeper
and more expressive. But suddenly a half-burned
stick fell apart, and a little twist of
flame filled almost the entire room with
light.</p>
<p>By its illumination the Indian was seen
standing at the foot of the ladder, his rifle
grasped in his left hand, his right at his hip,
while his body was crouching in the attitude
of intense attention, and as if he were on the
point of making a leap forward.</p>
<p>He happened to be looking toward the fireplace;
but, fortunately for the women, both
were gazing straight at him. He glanced to
the right and left, and, catching sight of the
figures behind him, wheeled like a panther,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
emitting a hiss of exultation at the knowledge
that he had found his victims at last.</p>
<p>But the first dart of his serpent-like eyes
showed the white woman, as immovable as a
statue, with her rifle levelled at his chest and
her delicate forefinger on the trigger.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shirril had the drop on him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you move, I will shoot you dead!&rdquo; she
said in a low voice, in which there was not the
first tremor.</p>
<p>Possibly the Comanche did not understand
the English tongue, but he could not mistake
her meaning. He knew that on the first
motion to raise his rifle, draw his knife, or
take one step toward the couple, he would be
slain where he stood. He, therefore, remained
as motionless as she who held him
at her mercy.</p>
<p>The tiny twist of flame on the hearth, that
had served our friends so well, would soon
burn itself out; it was already flickering, and,
if left alone, the room would soon be in darkness
again, and the situation would undergo a
radical change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinah,&rdquo; said her mistress, without changing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
her position, or raising her voice, &ldquo;keep
the fire burning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m, I will,&rdquo; she replied, shuffling hurriedly
across the floor to the hearth, where she
stooped down. She scorned to turn out of
the way of the prisoner, lest he should fancy
he was held in fear. She passed him almost
close enough to touch, and showed her contempt
by shaking her fist at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you willian! I&rsquo;d like to wring your
neck for comin&rsquo; into my dispartment without
axin&rsquo; permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange flicker shot from the eyes of the
warrior as they followed her for a moment,
but he neither moved nor spoke, his gaze
reverting again to his conqueror.</p>
<p>Under the deft manipulation of Dinah&rsquo;s
fingers, the flames shot up with more vigor
than before. Then, recalling the risk that this
involved, Mrs. Shirril told her to come to
her side, where she would be out of range of
any of their enemies who might be near the
windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will burn for a considerable time,&rdquo;
added the lady, referring to the fire the servant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
had renewed, &ldquo;so, if you please, you
may go to the scuttle and see how the captain
is getting along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to do that, missis?&rdquo;
asked Dinah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must watch this person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do dat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mistress, however, read her meaning
in her tones and manner. She was eager to
get a chance at the fellow, and, if she did,
even for only a few seconds, it would go hard
with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I will attend to him; do as I told
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no questioning the decision of the
little lady, and Dinah, with another threatening
gesture at the painted face of the savage,
went by him and began climbing the ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neber mind,&rdquo; she said to herself, though
her mistress overheard the words, &ldquo;when I
come downstairs again, I&rsquo;ll cotch one ob my
feet and tumble onto you, and you&rsquo;ll be
squashed worser dan if de house tumbled ober
your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captive seemed to understand what all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
this meant. He had escaped thus far, but he
might well fear the consequences, after the
man aloft put in an appearance.</p>
<p>Dinah had hardly passed out of sight when
the Comanche said in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me go&ndash;&ndash;won&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the intonation of the words was
wrong, the woman knew from the glance at
the door, which accompanied them, that he
meant to ask permission to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can go,&rdquo; was the astonishing
answer, and she nodded her head.</p>
<p>The Indian moved hesitatingly at first, in
the direction of the entrance, keeping his
gleaming eyes on the woman, as if doubtful
whether she understood him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, be quick,&rdquo; she added reassuringly,
though she took care that the old-fashioned
weapon was not lowered or turned aside.</p>
<p>The voices of the servant and her master
were plainly heard above, and the Comanche
saw it was no time for tarrying. A couple
more steps took him to the door, and, with
little effort, he lifted the huge bolt from its
place, pulled open the structure, and whisked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
out in the darkness, without so much as a
&ldquo;good-night&rdquo; or &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The instant he vanished, Mrs. Shirril set
down her gun, darted forward, and slipped
back the bolt, making the door as secure as
before.</p>
<p>It was a strange act on her part thus
releasing the red miscreant who was seeking
her life, but, after all, it was characteristic of
her sex.</p>
<p>She had little more than time to set things
to rights, as may be said, when she stepped
back and away from the windows, and sat
down in the nearest chair. A slight reaction
came over her; she felt weak, though she
knew it would not amount to anything: she
had been through too many perils before.</p>
<p>The feet and lower limbs of Captain Shirril
soon appeared on the rounds of the ladder,
with Dinah close behind him. In her eagerness
to get at the Indian, she stooped forward,
so that her big dusky face showed almost over
his shoulders. She was just getting ready to
fall on the warrior, when she observed that he
was gone.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s dat willian?&rdquo; she demanded,
glancing round the dimly lit room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Edna, I heard you had a guest down
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asked me to let him go, and I thought
it was the best way to get rid of him,&rdquo; replied
the wife with a smile, for her strength was
returning to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; snorted the disgusted Dinah,
as one of her feet came down on the floor with
a bang, &ldquo;I&rsquo;s got my &rsquo;pinion of sich foolishness
as dat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me hear how it was, Edna,&rdquo; said the
husband, laughing in spite of himself.</p>
<p>She quickly gave the particulars, and he in
turn told what he had passed through during
his sojourn on the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow deserved something, but, after
all, I find no fault with your action. Much as
I am exasperated against these Comanches
for their attack, I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling an
admiration for this fellow, who got the better
of me in the neatest style I ever had it done in
all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not time we heard something from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
Avon?&rdquo; asked the wife; &ldquo;he certainly has
been gone more than an hour&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shouts, whoops, and the reports of guns
and pistols suddenly broke the stillness on the
outside.</p>
<p>Most of the voices bore a familiar sound,
and there were a dash and vim about the
whole business which left no doubt of its
meaning.</p>
<p>In the firelight of the room, husband and
wife looked in each other&rsquo;s glowing faces,
and instinctively the two uttered the same
expression:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys have arrived!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>THROUGH THE BUSH.</h3>
</div>
<p>Oscar Gleeson the cowboy, who appeared
at such a timely juncture for Avon
Burnet, when he was hard pressed by his Comanche
pursuer, took the young man on his
mustang behind him, as the reader will recall,
and set out for the camp, several miles distant.</p>
<p>Despite the fears of the youth for the
safety of his friends in the cabin, the veteran
ranchman was more concerned for the fifty-odd
cattle that had chosen to stampede themselves,
and were at that moment dashing over
the prairie for no one could tell where.</p>
<p>But inasmuch as the captain had sent for
help, it must be given, regardless of other
matters, and the easy swing of the mustang
continued until the two arrived at the fire that
had been kindled in a small valley, where the
provision wagon was stationed with the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
animals tethered near, ready for the start that
was set for an early hour the next morning.</p>
<p>Most of the men had stretched themselves
out in the wagon to sleep, for a hard and
arduous campaign was before them, in which
they were likely to be compelled to keep
their horses for fifteen or twenty hours at a
stretch, changing them when necessary and
catching snatches of slumber as chance
presented.</p>
<p>But the unaccountable stampede of a portion
of the herd had roused all, and, at the
moment &ldquo;Ballyhoo,&rdquo; as he was known to his
friends, reined up, preparations were under
way for a general start after the absent ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Madstone and Shackaye?&rdquo; asked
Gleeson, looking down in the faces of the
group, dimly shown in the firelight, and
noticing that two of their number were
missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They started out for the cattle a little
while ago,&rdquo; replied one of the ranchmen,
&ldquo;thinking as how you might not be able to
manage them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d fetched &rsquo;em back all right,&rdquo; replied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
Gleeson, &ldquo;if it hadn&rsquo;t been for some other
business that turned up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reds are down at the cabin raising
the mischief; a lot of &rsquo;em got after Baby
here, and I had to drop one, and then take
him on my hoss and bring him along with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he doing out at night on
foot?&rdquo; was the natural query of another of
the cowboys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, he was putting in the tallest kind of
running, when I set eyes on him; if he had
kept it up, I don&rsquo;t believe I would have been
able to overhaul him myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark caused several of the grinning
ranchmen to turn toward Avon, who had
slipped off the horse and laughed as he made
answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got into the worst scrape of my life,&rdquo; he
explained, &ldquo;and it would have gone hard with
me if Ballyhoo hadn&rsquo;t turned up just as he
did. The reason I was abroad was because
Uncle Dohm thought it best I should come to
camp after you fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with <i>him</i>?&rdquo; asked
one, who, despite the brief explanation already
given, could not understand how it was
their leader and his family were in special
danger, even if their home was surrounded by
Comanches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The folks could stand them off for a week,
or month, if they had water and provisions, if
it wasn&rsquo;t for one thing; the roof of the cabin
is as dry as tinder, and the captain knows
they intend to set fire to it. If they do, nothing
can save the folks, for the building will
burn down before we can get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was putting a new face on matters, and
the ranchmen realized that more serious work
was required of them than rounding up the
strayed cattle. Captain Shirril was too brave
a man to feel needless alarm, and the fact that
he had sent for help was proof that there was
urgent need of it.</p>
<p>Two of the party were gone and might not
be back for several hours. That, however,
was of no account, since, including young
Burnet, seven were left, and not one of them
would have hesitated, with his companions, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
attack a party of Comanches two or three
times as numerous as that which had laid
siege to the captain&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>These men were fully armed with Winchester,
revolvers, and knives, they had no
superiors as horsemen, they were accustomed
to the rough out-door life, and it may be said
that all welcomed the chance of a stirring
brush with the red men that had been hovering
in their vicinity so long, but who took
care to avoid anything in the nature of a fair
stand-up fight.</p>
<p>There were horses for all, including Avon
Burnet, and, in a very brief space of time, the
men were in the saddle and heading toward
the home of their leader.</p>
<p>It would be hard to find a company of cowboys
or plainsmen whose members are not
known by distinctive names, generally based
on some personal peculiarity. Thus young
Burnet, as we have stated, was nearly always
addressed as &ldquo;Baby,&rdquo; because of his youth.
Oscar Gleeson, one of the most skilful and
famous cowmen of the Southwest, was addressed
as &ldquo;Ballyhoo,&rdquo; for the reason that,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
whenever he indulged in a shout or loud call,
he used that exclamation.</p>
<p>Hauser Files, the associate of Gleeson, once
took part in a game of baseball in San
Antonio, during which he received the elusive
sphere on the point of his nose. He withdrew
in disgust from the amusement, and was
always known thereafter as Short Stop.</p>
<p>Gleeson and Files were between thirty and
forty years of age, but Ward Burrell, from
the lowlands of Arkansas, had rounded his
half-century of existence, acquiring during the
journey such a peculiar complexion that he
was known as Old Bronze. Andy Wynwood,
from the same State, was younger. One of
his most stirring narratives related to the
manner in which he escaped hydrophobia,
after being bitten by a rabid wolf. He
claimed that the only thing that saved him
was the use of a madstone. Whether he was
mistaken or not is not for us to say, but there
was certainly no mistake about the origin of
the name of Madstone, which clung to him
forever afterward.</p>
<p>Antonio Nunez, the Mexican, was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
&ldquo;Greaser,&rdquo; Zach Collis from New Mexico,
who was also more than fifty years of age,
was &ldquo;Rickety,&rdquo; because of a peculiarity in
his gait, while George Garland was &ldquo;Jersey
George,&rdquo; for no other reason than that he
was born in the State of New Jersey.</p>
<p>The remaining member of Captain Shirril&rsquo;s
party was Shackaye, a Comanche Indian,
about a year older than Avon Burnet, concerning
whom we shall soon have something to
say further.</p>
<p>Captain Shirril was right when he expressed
his belief that the arrival of his friends would
be in the nature of one of those wild western
cyclones, which have grown quite familiar of
late in the West and Southwest.</p>
<p>The cowboys swung along at an easy gallop,
until near the cabin. They wanted to arrive
without giving the Comanches more notice
than was inevitable; but, when they knew
their approach could be concealed no longer,
they drove their spurs into the flanks of their
ponies, gave utterance to their wild whoops,
and went forward on a dead run.</p>
<p>Before this, the Indians must have suspected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
that matters were not progressing
right. They were aware that one or more
white men were in the vicinity, and as a matter
of course knew of the Texan camp, only
a few miles away. If the cowboys had not
learned what was going on from the reports
of the guns, they must soon learn it from the
whites, who were not only near the building,
but who managed to keep out of their
clutches.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the red men had already
lost several of their best warriors, and having
been repeatedly baffled in their attempts to
fire the building, were considering a withdrawal,
at the moment they were joined by
their comrade, who received such unmerited
mercy from Mrs. Shirril.</p>
<p>The shouts, firing of guns, and tramp of the
horses settled the question off-hand. There
was an instant scattering to their own steeds,
upon whose backs they vaulted, and then,
<a name='TC_4'></a><ins class="tnchg" title="Was 'tnrning' in original text">turning</ins> their heads toward the mesquite bush,
they sent them flying away at breakneck
speed.</p>
<p>But the Texans were not to be disappointed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
of their entertainment in that style. Catching
a glimpse of the scurrying horsemen,
they were after them like so many thunderbolts,
firing their pistols and rifles, even when
there was no chance of hitting anything.
There was no time to aim, and they took the
chances of so much powder accomplishing
something, when burned with ardor and
eagerness.</p>
<p>Thus it came about that, within a minute
after the arrival of our friends, they were out
of sight again in the brush, doing their utmost
to teach the marauders a lesson that
would keep them forever away from that
neighborhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ballyhoo&rdquo; fixed his eye on one of the red
men, who seemed to be at the rear. He was
in fact the very fellow whose life had been
spared by Mrs. Shirril. Arriving on the
ground at the last moment, he was obliged to
run several rods before reaching his horse;
but he did it quickly, and, turning his head
toward the bush, dashed after his companions
and was almost upon their heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my game!&rdquo; exclaimed Gleeson,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
banging away with his revolver at him, but,
so far as he could see, without effect.</p>
<p>The mesquite bush was not vigorous enough
to offer much obstruction to the mustangs,
though it was much more objectionable than
the open plain. The horses could plunge
through it, almost as if it were so much tall
grass, besides which it gave something of
shelter to the Comanches, who were now fleeing
for their lives.</p>
<p>Flinging themselves forward on the necks
of their steeds, who were as fleet as those of
their pursuers, with the brush swaying on all
sides, they became such bad targets that only
chance or wonderful skill could tumble them
to the earth.</p>
<p>Gleeson was so close to the savage he had
singled out as his special target, and his own
steed coursed so swiftly through the bush,
that it looked as if he would down his man.
The fugitive was hardly visible, as he
stretched forward, not upon his horse&rsquo;s neck,
but along the further side and almost under
it. About the only part of his person within
reach was his foot, the toes of which were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
curved over the spine of his animal, and his
left arm, which clasped the neck from below.</p>
<p>It was useless, therefore, for the Texan to
try any sort of aim, and when he discharged
his pistol now and then, until the chambers
were emptied, it was with the same hope as
before, that by accident one of the missiles
would reach home.</p>
<p>But this little amusement was not to be
entirely on the side of the pursuer. Suddenly
there was a flash beneath the neck of the
mustang, a resounding report, and the bullet
grazed the temple of the enthusiastic cowboy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, old fellow,&rdquo; he muttered,
shoving his smaller weapon in his holster, and
bringing his Winchester round in front; &ldquo;it
makes things more lively when they are not
one-sided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent forward, and, sighting as best he
could, fired. A whinnying scream rang out
in the confusion, and the mustang plunged
forward on his knees and rolled over on his
side, stone dead because of the bullet that
had bored its way through his brain.</p>
<p>Such a mishap would have been fatal to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
majority of riders, but the wonderful activity
of the Comanche saved him from harm
because of the fall of his animal. He struck
the ground on his feet, and showed a tremendous
burst of speed, as he took up the interrupted
flight of his horse, keeping straight on,
without darting to the right or left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you now,&rdquo; exclaimed the exultant
Texan, holding the nose of his animal toward
him.</p>
<p>Astonishing as was the fleetness of the
Comanche, it could not equal that of the intelligent
mustang, that knew what was needed
from him. He wanted no guidance from his
rider, who was therefore left free to manipulate
his Winchester as best he could with
the brush whipping about him.</p>
<p>All at once the gun was brought to his
shoulder, but, before it was fired, the Indian
dropped his head, dodged to one side, and
vanished as if by magic.</p>
<p>Where he had gone was a mystery to the
Texan, whose steed checked himself so suddenly
that the rider was nearly thrown from
his saddle.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>There was so much noise and confusion that
Gleeson could not hear clearly, but something
caused him to turn his head, under the impression
that he detected a movement near at
hand.</p>
<p>He was just in time to catch a glimpse of
the Comanche, darting through the bush in a
direction almost the opposite of that which
he had been following so long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the mischief did you get there?&rdquo;
was the astonished exclamation of the Texan,
as he again brought his rifle to a level.</p>
<p>At the moment of doing so, he comprehended
how it all came about. The Comanche
had darted directly under the mustang, doing
so with a quickness and skill that baffled the
eye of his foe. Few, even of his own people,
could have performed the exploit which he
executed with perfection.</p>
<p>Ballyhoo Gleeson lowered his gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go! I&rsquo;ll be hanged if you don&rsquo;t
deserve to get away after <i>that</i> trick!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>THUNDERBOLT.</h3>
</div>
<p>Avon Burnet knew that when the cattlemen
reached a point within a half
mile of his home, and the fire had not yet
been started, that all danger was over. It
was beyond the power of the assailants, with
the slight time at their command, to harm the
defenders.</p>
<p>Then naturally his thoughts turned to his
mustang Thunderbolt, that had been left in
the mesquite bush with the animal belonging
to his uncle. The chances were that
the Comanches had captured both, but he
was not without hope regarding his own
pony.</p>
<p>The steed was so intelligent that he was certain
to resist the approach of a stranger at
night, especially if he were an Indian. The
redskins were so occupied in trying to encompass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
the death of the Texan and his family,
besides being well supplied with their own
steeds, that they were not likely to put forth
much effort to capture a single animal.</p>
<p>The youth was as eager as his companions
to do his part in driving off the red men, but
the chance was denied him. The spare horse
which he rode, and which he put to his best
pace, could not hold his own with the rest,
and consequently he arrived at the rear of the
procession.</p>
<p>He glanced right and left, but caught the
outlines of but one figure, whose identity he
suspected, because he was standing in front of
the cabin door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helloa, uncle, is that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Avon; I see you have arrived; I
hope you suffered no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matters were stirring for a time, but I am
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, Mrs. Shirril and Dinah,
recognizing the voice, opened the door, the
captain inviting them to come outside.</p>
<p>The fire was now burning so briskly on the
hearth that the interior was well illuminated,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
so that their figures were plainly stamped
against the yellow background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anything left for you to do,&rdquo;
said the captain, &ldquo;so you may as well
dismount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The firing, shouts, and yells came from a
remote point in the bush, and were rapidly
receding.</p>
<p>Avon came down from his saddle, kissed his
aunt, shook hands with his uncle, and spoke
kindly to Dinah, who was proud of the
handsome fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; said he briskly, &ldquo;what do you
suppose, has become of your horse Jack and
Thunderbolt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taken off by the Comanches, or killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that is probable, but I shall
make a search for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Believing this could be done better on foot,
he left the pony in charge of his relative and
walked hastily into the bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose there is much hope, but I
have an idea that maybe Thunderbolt has
been wounded and needs looking after. The
bullets have been flying pretty thickly during
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
the last few minutes, and for that matter,&rdquo;
he added, pausing a few seconds to listen,
&ldquo;they are not through yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the edge of the bush he encountered a
horseman, whose voice, when hailed, showed
that he was &ldquo;Jersey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; asked Avon, pausing
to exchange words with his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aint nothing more to do,&rdquo; was the response;
&ldquo;the varmints are travelling faster
than this horse can go, though he was one of
their animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got it in the neck&ndash;&ndash;that is my critter
did. I had one of them pretty well pinned,
when he fired from under his horse&rsquo;s belly
and my pony went down, as dead as a doornail.
I came mighty nigh being mashed under
him, but I dropped the other chap, for all I
couldn&rsquo;t see him when I drew bead. I &rsquo;spose
it was a chance shot, but the minute he went
off his horse got so bewildered he didn&rsquo;t
know what to do with himself. While he was
trotting about, I catched him, put my bridle on
him without trouble, and here I am, Baby.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure he isn&rsquo;t one of ours?&rdquo; asked Avon,
approaching still nearer and looking him over
as well as he could in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is now, but he wasn&rsquo;t fifteen minutes
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing that he was not Thunderbolt, the
youth was hopeful that it might prove Jack;
but it took only a minute to learn that Jersey
was right. The steed had been brought to
the spot by one of the Comanches and was a
fine animal, though so much time passed
before the Texan secured him that he was
simply prudent in not trying to follow after
the red men, who were far beyond reach.</p>
<p>Jersey laughed when Avon told him his
errand, but said he would not be much surprised
if he was successful, for the reasons
which have been already stated.</p>
<p>There had been hot work in the bush,
for when the cattlemen charged the Comanches,
they did so with all the vigor of
their nature. These Indians were among
the most persistent thieves in Texas, and,
as the reader knows, the man who attempts
to run off another&rsquo;s cattle or horses commits
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
a more flagrant crime in that section
of our Union than he does when he seeks
the owners&rsquo; lives.</p>
<p>Avon bore to the left, leaving the principal
theatre of the scrimmage, and had not reached
the border of the mesquite when he almost
stumbled over a fine horse that lay on its side,
without a particle of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether that is Thunderbolt,&rdquo;
he said, with a feeling of dread, as he bent
over to examine the body.</p>
<p>Drawing a rubber safe from his pocket, he
struck a match, and by the tiny flame looked
at the head and side of the dead steed.</p>
<p>One scrutinizing glance was enough; the
body was not that of his own favorite, but of
Jack, belonging to his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Jack!&rdquo; murmured the youth with a
thrill of sympathy, &ldquo;you have been on many
a stirring campaign, but you will go on no
more. I wonder how it was you met your
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It looked as if the mustang had been
stricken by a stray shot, that may have been
fired by a friend, for it was not to be supposed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
that a Comanche would have killed him purposely,
when he would have been a valuable
prize.</p>
<p>The bridle and saddle were in the cabin, so
that the owner had simply lost one of his
horses, his supply of extra ones being sufficient
to replace him without trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid there is little chance of finding
Thunderbolt alive,&rdquo; added the youth, as he
resumed his search.</p>
<p>He made his way through the bush with the
utmost care, for, although the Indians had
been sharply repulsed, he was aware of the
custom of those people, when any of their
number are killed or wounded. The survivors
put forth every exertion to take them away
with them, having the horror of their race
against any falling into the hands of their
enemies. It was more than likely that when
the sun rose not a body would be anywhere in
sight. Even the warrior who had run him so
hard, only to succumb to the rifle of Ballyhoo
Gleeson, would not be forgotten by his former
comrades.</p>
<p>Advancing with the utmost caution, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
heard a rustling in the bush in front. Quite
sure that it was caused by his enemies, he
stood a minute or two listening, uncertain
whether to advance or withdraw. But he
found the parties were receding, and he ventured
to steal forward in order to gain a closer
sight of them.</p>
<p>A short walk took him to the edge of the
mesquite, where the additional light offered a
partial view of a strange scene.</p>
<p>Two able-bodied warriors were supporting a
third between them. The wounded one was
able to walk slowly with help, but it was
apparent that he was badly hurt, for he
leaned heavily upon his support, who stopped
at intervals to give him rest.</p>
<p>Finally the party halted, and one of them
emitted a tremulous but sharp whistle. The
signal was for a couple of their own horses,
which loomed to sight in the gloom, as they
advanced in obedience to the command.</p>
<p>Fearful of being discovered, if he left the
bush, Avon kept in the shadow and watched
the party. His view was indistinct, but it was
easy to see that the two warriors were lifting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
their wounded companion upon the back of
one of the mustangs. When this was done a
Comanche took his seat behind him, so as to
hold him in place by passing an arm around
his waist. Those people had no need of
saddles, their accoutrement consisting of the
single thong fastened around the head of the
animal, and by which he could be guided at
the will of his master. Indeed, many of the
Comanches ride without any such aid at all,
their intelligent animals being obedient to
their voices, and seeming to comprehend their
wishes as if by intuition.</p>
<p>Soon after the mustangs and their riders
faded from view in the gloom, the horses on
a moderate walk. They would have proven
easy victims to a couple of the cattlemen, had
they appeared at this moment, but, much as
the fiery ranchmen despised and hated this
tribe, it may be doubted whether there was
one of their number who would have taken
advantage of such an opportunity.</p>
<p>The Texans were ready to fight at all
times, but there is a chivalry in their composition
which prevents their taking an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
unfair advantage of a foe. They would
have allowed the trio to ride away unmolested,
which is just what the Comanches
would not have done, had their situations
been reversed.</p>
<p>Avon Burnet was considering whether it
was worth while to push his search further,
when, to his surprise, an exclamation broke
upon his ear, in the form of a vigorous
&ldquo;<i>Oofh!</i>&rdquo; as nearly as it can be put in
letters.</p>
<p>He knew it came from the lips of an
Indian, who was not far off, though in a
different direction from that taken by the
warriors and their wounded comrade. It
was more to the south, though the penetrating
glance he cast in that direction failed
to reveal the individual.</p>
<p>But it was heard again, and now, when he
looked, he was able to catch the dim outlines
of a horse, walking slowly toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the Comanches
to-night?&rdquo; the puzzled youth asked himself;
&ldquo;they seem to be up to all manner
of tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>As the horseman gradually became more
distinct, he saw that the rider was in an
odd quandary. He was striving to turn the
animal in the opposite direction, but he
would not obey. He flung up his head,
sometimes reared angrily, and, though he
maintained a walk, kept pushing straight
on toward the bush, despite the savage
attempts of the rider to make him wheel
about.</p>
<p>A suspicion flashed through the mind of
Avon. The man was an Indian beyond
question, and the horse could not be his
own, for, if it were, he would have obeyed
him without urging. It must be one of the
Texan horses that he was trying to steal.</p>
<p>The youth uttered the familiar signal by
which he was able at all times to bring
Thunderbolt to his side, when he was within
hearing. The mustang replied with a
glad whinny, and broke into a trot straight
for his master. It was indeed his prized
animal, with a Comanche warrior on his
back.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXIII_GOODBY' id='CHAPTER_XXIII_GOODBY'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h3>&ldquo;GOOD-BY!&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<p>The Comanche must have been disgusted.
He had been trying for some time to
steal the mustang of Avon Burnet, with the
result that the pony was about to steal him,
unless he prevented it offhand.</p>
<p>The Indian heard the whistle from the edge
of the bush, and the instant increase of speed,
on the part of the stubborn mustang, made
the meaning clear to him. He did not know
but that three or four Texans were waiting in
the mesquite, and that, if he stayed on the
back of the steed a minute longer, he would
be carried directly into their arms.</p>
<p>Consequently he did not hesitate. He
went off of Thunderbolt, as if struck by a
cannon ball, and, heading out on the prairie,
ran with might and main, quickly disappearing
in the darkness, and was seen no more.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my own Thunderbolt!&rdquo; exclaimed
the delighted Avon, patting the nose of his
beast, who was as happy as he at being
restored to his young master; &ldquo;I thought I
would never see you again, but here you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang upon the bare back, and the
pony started through the bush for the cabin.</p>
<p>Arriving there, matters were found in a
satisfactory shape. Ballyhoo Gleeson was
the only cowboy that had remained behind
with Captain Shirril. The rest had started to
look after the cattle. It has been shown that
a number had been stampeded, and since all
care was necessarily withdrawn from the
others, they were likely to follow suit. Then,
too, it was probable that the Comanches would
see their chance of securing some of the herd,
and would make the attempt despite the
rough handling they had received.</p>
<p>Nothing could have attested more strikingly
the fact that our friends were accustomed to
their wild, dangerous life, than the manner in
which they now acted. A half hour before,
the little family within the cabin considered
themselves in such imminent peril of being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
burned to death that they allowed young
Burnet to run the greatest risk to secure help,
before it was too late.</p>
<p>But now Captain Shirril and Ballyhoo
Gleeson sat before the fire, that was burning
brightly, smoking their pipes, and talking as
though the occurrence was of the most ordinary
nature. The ranchman had made sure
of his supply of tobacco, and intended to ride
back to camp, after spending an hour or so
within the house.</p>
<p>Everyone had eaten supper before the lively
incidents opened, and Mrs. Shirril now resumed
her sitting in front of the fire, occasionally
taking part in the words of her husband
and guests. Dinah was heard muttering
angrily to herself upstairs, as she investigated
the damages done by the visitor in her apartment.</p>
<p>Avon, on his return, told his uncle about
his horse, explaining that he was fortunate
enough to recover Thunderbolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were luckier than I supposed you
would be,&rdquo; said the captain, as his nephew
drew up his chair near them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; asked the wife, &ldquo;that
the Comanches will trouble us further, husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no danger,&rdquo; he replied, calmly
puffing his pipe; &ldquo;is there, Ballyhoo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; was the calm response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps that because they had
suffered so severely, they would come back
to revenge themselves,&rdquo; ventured the little
woman, still busily plying her needle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you see the damage was done, not by
you and Dinah, though you did your part, but
by the men, and <i>them&rsquo;s</i> the ones they&rsquo;ll go
for,&rdquo; observed Ballyhoo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not the invariable rule with
Indians,&rdquo; was the truthful remark of Mrs.
Shirril. &ldquo;It makes little difference to them
whether the innocent or guilty suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the husband, &ldquo;the prime
object of the redskins is cattle, with perhaps
horses thrown in. You know they have been
hanging round for a number of days, waiting
for a chance before we started north; they
will make an effort to run off those stampeded
cattle to-night, and likely enough will follow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
us into the Indian Nation, on the watch for a
chance to gather in several hundred hoofs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s encouraging,&rdquo;
said Avon, addressing all his friends;
&ldquo;you know how dry the roof of the house is.
If Dinah hadn&rsquo;t put her foot down when she
did, there would have been no cabin at this
moment. The Comanches tried to fire the
sides, and failing in that, gave their attention
to the roof, where they came so near
succeeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you refer to as encouraging,
Avon?&rdquo; asked his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a storm in the air; we are going
to have a regular driving rain, that will soak
the roof until a ton of live-coals on the top
wouldn&rsquo;t set fire to the planking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby is right,&rdquo; said Ballyhoo, with a
nod of his head; &ldquo;rain will fall within
twelve hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>is</i> good news,&rdquo; said the wife, with
a pleased look; &ldquo;I shall now see the captain
and the rest of you leave without a
misgiving as concerns ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t feel frightened, Edna, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
old Wygwind and his gang of imps should
come whooping down upon you?&rdquo; asked
the captain, looking sideways, with an expression
of admiration and love glowing
from his shaggy face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to say we would not be
frightened, but Dinah and I would feel
secure inside, so long as there was no danger
of the building being burned. I wonder
whether Wygwind led this party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he did; he&rsquo;s
one of the worst scamps that ever lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; assented Ballyhoo. &ldquo;I
believe he led this gang, though a chap
couldn&rsquo;t tell in the darkness. You know
what a thief he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The allusion was to the notorious Comanche
Wygwind, one of the many leaders
belonging to that tribe. He was a powerful,
wiry Indian, in middle life, who had
long been detested by the ranchmen for his
thievish and brutal propensities. He had
stolen hundreds of cattle, not to mention
horses, and though often pursued, and
driven more than once into dangerous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
quarters, he had managed in some way to
pull through to the present time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he should get inside,&rdquo; said the captain
slyly, &ldquo;and you should get the drop
on him, wife, I advise that you don&rsquo;t let
him walk out of the door unharmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on circumstances,&rdquo; quietly
replied his better half; &ldquo;if he should
appeal to me, and he had done no particular
harm, I could hardly refuse him. However,
I don&rsquo;t think if he does enter it will
be through the scuttle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next time it will be best to turn
him over to the mercies of Dinah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid it will go ill with him if I do.
I heard her say to herself, when she went
upstairs after you, that, on the return trip, she
meant to fall from the round of the ladder
upon him: the result would have been
frightful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that red man doesn&rsquo;t know all that
he escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mutterings of Dinah were still audible
overhead, and she was seen the next minute,
descending the primitive stairs.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>The little party smiled, and the captain
turned toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dinah, you didn&rsquo;t find much damage
done in your room, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! &rsquo;cause de warmint didn&rsquo;t hab
time. I only wish I had a chance to wrung
his neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt you would have done it, but I
think we all have cause for gratitude that
things turned out as well as they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you didn&rsquo;t notice dat big hole
dey come nigh burning frough de roof, did
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I saw it; it would have been
much worse but for you; I hope the fire
didn&rsquo;t injure your shoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her foot and looked at the
broad sole of the heavy shoe, as though the
thought had not occurred to her before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It am scorchified a little,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; remarked Ballyhoo
gravely; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give out a contract for a
new pair for you, when we get into Kansas,
and send a couple of the boys back with
them, if they don&rsquo;t prove too big a load.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I consider such remarks as onnecessary
and slightsome,&rdquo; replied Dinah, with a
scornful toss of her head; &ldquo;I wore number
&rsquo;lebens, which am just a lady&rsquo;s size; I
reckons you can&rsquo;t do much better dan dat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my feet keep on growing for a few
years, I may get there in time, but you
shall have the shoes, Dinah, if the right
size can be bought in any of the big establishments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;ank you,&rdquo; replied the African, who
thought it best not to repel the offer of her
friend; &ldquo;dese am gettin&rsquo; wored consid&rsquo;ble,
and by de time you got back, I&rsquo;ll need
anoder pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evening was advancing. In answer
to Ballyhoo&rsquo;s inquiries, Captain Shirril
looked at his watch, and said that it was
nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be off,&rdquo; remarked the tall ranchman,
rising to his feet; &ldquo;we make an early
start, and I don&rsquo;t know how the boys have
made out with the cattle; they may need
my help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may as well go with you,&rdquo; said Avon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
looking inquiringly at his uncle; &ldquo;for there
is to be no more work here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be just as well,&rdquo; replied the
captain.</p>
<p>The youth took his saddle and accoutrements
from the corner, where they had been
lying, and stepping outside, adjusted them
upon Thunderbolt, who whinnied with
pleasure at the promise of carrying his
loved owner on his back indefinitely. The
two had become attached by their companionship
on the hunt and ranch, and the
delight of the youth on recovering his mustang
was beyond expression.</p>
<p>While he was busy at this brief task, the
members of the little family kept their feet,
discussing matters in which each was
interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m ready, Ballyhoo,&rdquo; called Avon,
in his cheery voice, stepping quickly through
the open door.</p>
<p>He placed one arm around the neck of his
aunt and kissed her affectionately, shook
hands with Dinah, adding as he crossed palms
with his uncle:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I expect to see you again, soon. Keep up
a good heart, auntie, while we are gone, which
I don&rsquo;t think will be for long. Good-by,
all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his foot in the stirrup, swung himself
into the saddle, at the same moment
that his companion did the same, and the
couple headed their animals to the northward.</p>
<p>Captain Shirril and the women remained in
the door, looking forth in the darkness, and
listening until the sounds of the hoofs died
out in the distance. Then the Texan led the
way inside, adjusting the bar in place so that
no one could enter without permission.</p>
<p>The extra horse which Avon had ridden to
the cabin was turned loose in the bush, to be
recovered and used by the captain when he
wished to ride to the camp. Ballyhoo had
removed the saddle and bridle, which lay in
the corner where Avon&rsquo;s had awaited him.</p>
<p>The Texan stood a minute, looking around
the room, as if trying to recall any forgotten
duty, but thought of none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is later than I suspected,&rdquo; said he,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
addressing his wife and consulting his watch
again; &ldquo;and we may as well retire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lighted a common tallow candle, and
with that in his hand, led the way up the
ladder, followed by the others. Fifteen
minutes later, everyone was sleeping as
soundly as though the evening had not been
disturbed by any unusual incident.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h3>A STRANGE DELAY.</h3>
</div>
<p>Meanwhile Avon Burnet and Gleeson
continued riding northward at an easy
gallop, their eyes and ears on the alert for
sounds of their friends or enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember this spot?&rdquo; asked the
elder, drawing his mustang down to a walk,
after going some distance.</p>
<p>The youth looked keenly round in the
gloom, but saw only the level plain, similar
to that over which they had ridden since
leaving the cabin. A dark object on the
ground caused him to force his pony toward
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be one of our cattle,&rdquo; he said
inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what is left of him; that&rsquo;s the steer
that the Comanche brought down when he
took a shot at you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, this is the place where you joined
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Percisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is <i>he</i>&ndash;&ndash;that is, his body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve took it off; you know how hard
the Comanches try to carry away their dead
and wounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a proof of that while hunting for
Thunderbolt, but I didn&rsquo;t think they would be
able to find this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have heard the shot and his
cry, and though we made things hum about
them, they took time to look into it and bear
the body away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder now whether that could have
been Wygwind,&rdquo; said Avon, referring to the
notorious leader of whom we have spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the decisive reply of Ballyhoo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a powerful brave Injin, but plenty of
his warriors can outrun him. This one was
too good on his feet to be him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The couple gave their horses rein again,
and they broke into a gallop which carried
them swiftly toward their destination. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
glimmer of the camp-fire was discerned when
they rode to the top of the next moderate
elevation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; exclaimed Ballyhoo, abruptly
checking his pony.</p>
<p>His companion did the same, for he had
caught the sound, which was that made by
many hoofs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The confounded beasts are still at it,&rdquo;
added the elder, allowing his steed to resume
his walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys may be driving them back to
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it doesn&rsquo;t sound right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you imagine the Comanches are taking
any hand in this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t strike me so, but there&rsquo;s no saying
what those varmints will do; they&rsquo;re so
fond of stealing that they&rsquo;ll run great risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, since the couple were able to
locate the running animals, they felt it their
duty to bear a hand in helping to bring them
back to camp. There was danger that if they
were not speedily brought under control, the
start could not be made on time.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Baby,&rdquo; called Gleeson, wheeling
his animal to the right, and sending him off at
a dead run.</p>
<p>Thunderbolt knew what was expected of
him, and without waiting for orders, stretched
away in the same direction, with the old thrill
stirring his rider at the prospect of exciting
work at hand.</p>
<p>It was not long before they caught sight of
the frightened animals, going as if a legion of
wolves were at their heels. They were running
from camp, and, unless their course
could be changed, would be far from it before
daylight.</p>
<p>In fact their presence so comparatively
near proved that they were either another
part of the main herd, or if the ones first
stampeded, had broken off again, after being
well on their way to their regular pasturing
grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out! they may be Comanches!&rdquo;
called Ballyhoo to his youthful companion.
&ldquo;No, they are not either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last remark was caused by the sight of
two of their friends riding like mad, shouting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
and swinging their whips, which they had
brought from camp. They were Madstone
and Rickety, who were doing all they knew
how to check the animals that seemingly
would not be checked or turned aside.</p>
<p>It looked as if Ballyhoo and Avon must be
trampled to death, for they were directly in
front of the rushing herd, but they swung
their arms, holding each his rifle aloft, and
shouted loud enough to be heard miles
distant.</p>
<p>The mustangs were a little nervous, but
were used to such experiences, and they did
not catch the contagion. They held their
ground, though it was manifest they would
have preferred to be somewhere else.</p>
<p>Suddenly, when the terrified beasts were
almost upon them, they swerved to one side.
The change of direction was slight, but it
was important as a beginning. The cowboys
were quick to take advantage of it, and
redoubled their shoutings and gesticulations.
The cattle trended further and further from
the course they had been following, and ere
long were headed toward the camp.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>They were now on the run and the four
men kept them there, determined that they
should not get away again.</p>
<p>Madstone explained that they were the
ones that took fright earlier in the evening,
and were on a dead run, when Ballyhoo
shot down the Comanche that was pursuing
Avon Burnet. The cattle had drifted a considerable
way, but they were soon brought
under control and headed in the right
direction.</p>
<p>All was going well, when off they went
again at a more frantic rate than before.
The cowboys were at loss to understand
what caused the new outbreak, when, to
their amazement, three Comanches appeared
in their front.</p>
<p>The dusky scamps did their best to run
them off, but it was evident they were afraid
of the Texans, who made a dash for them,
whereupon they disappeared.</p>
<p>But they had turned the cattle in a new
direction, and the Texans had all their
work to do over again. There was little
prospect of success, until Ballyhoo and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
Avon added their efforts, when matters
assumed a better shape.</p>
<p>But the trouble was by no means over.
If these animals should plunge into the
main herd at the rate they were now going,
they were sure to spread the panic, with
the probability that the whole two thousand
would soon be on the run, and the difficulty
of the ranchmen intensified ten-fold.</p>
<p>Accordingly, as the ground was approached,
the four horsemen resorted to the well-known
practice of what may be called rounding-up.
They galloped back and forth, on the outer
edge of the herd, and here and there, circumnavigating
them continually and as fast as the
fleetness of their mustangs would permit.</p>
<p>By this means they finally succeeded in
turning the heads of the cattle toward each
other, and they were crowded into a compact
mass, whose members were obliged to stand
still, since they were huddled in one heap,
with the yelling cowboys careering back and
forth, around the circumference.</p>
<p>This was not accomplished a moment too
soon, for they were close upon the main herd,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
which showed a restlessness that might have
broken forth into another stampede, but for
the skill of the other cowboys who had them
in charge.</p>
<p>When the reunion of the Texans took place
near the camp-fire, and there was a general
talk over the incidents of the evening, the arrangements
were made for the night. All had
been so actively engaged that rest would have
been acceptable, but there was not one who
would have murmured, had he been ordered
to take his position and hold it for hours.</p>
<p>Indeed Avon Burnet volunteered to do his
part in looking after the cattle that it was
necessary to keep under watch through the
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Ballyhoo, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fixed it.
You and me will take a hand to-morrow night,
when we&rsquo;re likely to find it a blamed sight
more unpleasant than now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That storm that we&rsquo;ve been talking about
is holding off, as though it finds it hard to
make up its mind to come, but it will be here
within twenty hours or less.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad of it,&rdquo; remarked the youth,
thinking of his friends in the distant cabin,
which had escaped burning by such a narrow
chance.</p>
<p>It was now past midnight, and those who
were to be off duty did not squander the
precious hours; but, crawling into the
covered wagon, bundled themselves up and
slept the sleep which waits on rugged health.</p>
<p>At the earliest streakings of light the
camp was astir. The man who served the
party as cook had no light task on his hands.
He generally carried a lot of wood in the
wagon with him, for the reason that it was
not always easy to obtain, and, by doing this,
he was sure of always having enough dry fuel
to burn readily when wanted.</p>
<p>Those Texans were satisfied at times to go
without anything at all in the way of food,
or to snatch a bite by checking their mustangs
long enough to allow them to receive it, when
they were off again; but whenever the opportunity
for a &ldquo;square meal&rdquo; presented itself,
they proved themselves full hands.</p>
<p>Gleeson, who acted as master during the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
absence of Captain Shirril, mounted his horse
and rode out to inspect the herd. He was
relieved to find them all in place. Most of
them were lying down, drowsily chewing their
cuds, but a few had risen and were cropping
the grass, which grew quite abundantly in the
neighborhood.</p>
<p>While employed in this duty, Ballyhoo
cast frequent looks in the direction of Captain
Shirril&rsquo;s home. He expected to see their
leader before it was light, but the sun was
already showing in the horizon and he was
not in sight.</p>
<p>The Texan galloped to the top of the adjoining
elevation, from which he could see the low
flat building in the distance. Shading his
eyes with his hand, he peered long and
earnestly, but without catching sight of a
horseman galloping toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very odd,&rdquo; thought Gleeson, &ldquo;that he
doesn&rsquo;t show up; something must have taken
place. I wonder if those varmints have come
back after Baby and I left last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed impossible that anything like this
should have occurred, but it was beyond his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
power to explain the non-appearance of the
&ldquo;boss&rdquo; on any other theory. He was prompt
and energetic, and was more likely to be
ahead than behind the time he set for his
own appearance at a particular place.</p>
<p>Without giving expression to his fears, he
joined the group at the wagon and partook of
his breakfast, washing down his food with a
cup of delicious steaming coffee. He avoided
Avon for a time, because he plainly saw the
young man was disturbed; but, when the
meal was finished, the remarks became general
over the absence of Captain Shirril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just come from the top of the swell,&rdquo;
said Madstone, who had been there since
Ballyhoo, &ldquo;and can&rsquo;t see anything of him. I
&rsquo;spose he has overslept himself, because of the
flurry last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could believe it is nothing worse,&rdquo;
said Avon, walking thoughtfully out to where
his mustang stood saddled and bridled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what else could it be, Baby?&rdquo;
asked Ballyhoo, repressing his own uneasiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want to find out; I tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
you, I don&rsquo;t think we ought to stay here,
when it&rsquo;s pretty sure something is wrong at
the house; if the Comanches are going to
keep this up, it will never do to leave the
women alone; I shall have to go back and
stay with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s that, but we shall soon
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang into the saddle, and the two rode
to the elevation which has already been
referred to several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will wait here,&rdquo; said the elder, checking
his animals, &ldquo;while you ride on to the
cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avon looked inquiringly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it best you should go
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I will keep you under my eye all the
way; if you see anything out of gear, you
need only to signal, and I will fetch two or
three of the boys with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It struck the youth as strange that Ballyhoo
should stop after starting for the dwelling.
The young man had made up his mind there
was something wrong there, and it seemed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
him like a waste of time for his friend to hold
back.</p>
<p>However, he said nothing further in the
way of protest, but, speaking briskly to
Thunderbolt, sent him off at headlong speed
toward the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid this knocks all my plans to
smithereens,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;for if
there is the least danger of the Comanches
putting in their appearance again, it would
never do for me to leave home. It is bad
enough for uncle to go, but there is no help in
his case, while there is in mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he drew near the dwelling his feelings
intensified, and all other thoughts went from
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see a sign of a living person,&rdquo; he
added, slowing the gait of his steed; &ldquo;suppose
the Comanches made a descent upon
them in the night and managed to secure
entrance&ndash;&ndash;well, by gracious!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h3>HEADING NORTHWARD.</h3>
</div>
<p>Avon Burnet&rsquo;s misgiving increased
as he drew near the cabin of his uncle,
for the unwonted stillness was impressive to
the last degree. The only sign of life which
caught his eye was the horse cropping the
grass near the mesquite bush.</p>
<p>It seemed dangerous to do as he did, but in
his anxiety he sprang to the ground and
walked hastily to the front of the dwelling.
Observing the latch-string out, he gave it a
sharp twitch and the door swung open.</p>
<p>Dinah confronted him with a look of surprise,
and just beyond her, he saw his aunt
preparing the morning meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Avon, you are frightened,&rdquo; said
she with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am; where&rsquo;s uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be down in a minute; when I
awoke, I saw he was asleep, and I concluded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
not to awake him. You know he had a hard
time yesterday and last night, and I took the
responsibility of not calling him. The poor
man needs rest and it won&rsquo;t hurt you folks to
wait a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth dropped into a chair and
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, that beats everything! We
were worried half to death, and feared something
dreadful had happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind; we haven&rsquo;t been
disturbed since you and Gleeson went away.
If we had, the captain would have been
awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman referred to was heard moving
about overhead, and a few minutes later
put in an appearance. He scolded his wife in
a good-natured way for her well-meant kindness,
and adding that no harm had been done,
sat down to his morning meal.</p>
<p>The preliminaries were quickly finished, the
good-by said, and leaping into his saddle, the
captain joined his nephew in a smart gallop
northward to camp, where they joined their
anxious friends.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>And so what promised to furnish a stirring
sensation proved nothing at all. It was rare
that the Texan allowed his weariness to get
the better of him, but it had done so in this
case, and none laughed more heartily over it
than he.</p>
<p>A brief investigation showed everything to
be in readiness, and the sun was not far above
the horizon when the start on the long journey
northward was made.</p>
<p>The cattle seemed to have recovered from
the restlessness of the night before, and were
as tractable as could be desired. They moved
forward at a moderate pace, having browsed
so fully on the succulent grass that it was
easy to keep them going, until nearly the
middle of the day. At this time a halt was
made for an hour, during which the cattle
spread out on the sides of the well-marked
trail, and ate as though they had not partaken
of food for days.</p>
<p>Shortly after resuming the journey a small
stream was reached, which was easily forded,
there being no portion where it was necessary
for the beasts to swim. All drank heartily,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
and, upon climbing the sloping bank on the
other side, another herd was observed several
miles to the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t got as many as we,&rdquo;
remarked the captain to Gleeson, who was
riding by his side; &ldquo;and I hope we shall
keep far enough apart to prevent our cattle
mixing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s off the trail,&rdquo; replied Ballyhoo, &ldquo;but
will come into it before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we keep moving briskly, he must strike
it behind us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It soon became evident that the other cattlemen
were trying to force their herd to a point
on the trail ahead of the larger drove, which
was strung along for many yards. Since they
were about equally far north, the struggle was
an interesting one for some time; but the
action of the smaller collection of cattle
showed they were not as manageable as the
larger one, and, before the close of day, they
gave over the struggle and dropped back so
far that, when they struck the trail, they were
fully a mile to the rear.</p>
<p>The promised storm still hung off, though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
the sky was cold and lowering, and toward
night a misty rain began falling. It did not
become severe at any time, but it added to
the dismal gloom. The wind blew in gusts,
much the same as on the previous evening,
and the temperature fell until, had the cowmen
been less accustomed to exposure, they
would have suffered more than their animals.</p>
<p>Our friends did not forget to keep a lookout
for the Comanches, who were likely to
show themselves, whenever a chance presented
itself for a raid upon the herd.</p>
<p>If they had been too roughly handled to
venture upon anything of the kind, there were
plenty of others to take their places, if only
the temptation was strong enough.</p>
<p>The misty rain shortened the view in every
direction, but the horsemen who dashed
hither and thither, when the cattle showed a
disposition to stray off, reported no signs of
their old enemies, who, however, might be
keeping out of sight until darkness should
settle over the earth.</p>
<p>Prudence required that the cattle should be
treated considerately, especially at the beginning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
of the long journey, for it was to the
interests of the owners that they should arrive
at their destination in good condition. Like
men in training for a pedestrian contest, particular
care was needed at the start to prevent
a general breakdown. After a few days the
beasts, if well used, would be able to stand
much more.</p>
<p>It, therefore, lacked considerable of night
when the final halt was made, and the cattle
were allowed to crop the grass until they
became sated and chose to lie down.</p>
<p>The men in charge of the other herd were
equally thoughtful, for they came to a pause
about the same time, with nearly a mile
separating the camps. It was hardly dark,
indeed, when a horseman was seen approaching
from the southward, on an easy gallop,
and there was no doubt that he belonged to
the other party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my old friend Sclevinger,&rdquo; said Captain
Shirril, recognizing the visitor, as he
saluted, and, checking his steed beside that
of the old Texan, extended his hand, with the
heartiest of salutations.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I suspected it was you,&rdquo; said the new
arrival, whose pleasant countenance was
covered by as shaggy a growth as that of the
captain, &ldquo;and I concluded I would run over
and shake hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, pard. I&rsquo;m mighty glad to
see you; you must take supper with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I guess I will,&rdquo; replied Sclevinger,
dismounting and accepting the invitation
as readily as it was given; &ldquo;I tried to
run in my herd ahead of you this afternoon,&rdquo;
he added, with a twinkle of his fine eyes, &ldquo;but
I couldn&rsquo;t quite make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw what you were up to, and we had
to bestir ourselves to head you off. How
many have you, colonel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only about twelve hundred&ndash;&ndash;that is, I
<i>had</i> twelve hundred, when I started from the
ranch two days ago, but we lost nearly a hundred
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo; asked the captain, as
they reached the provision wagon, and
paused while the cook made their meal
ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A confounded lot of Comanches cut out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
some of our cattle, and, despite all we could
do, got off with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been hanging round us, but
didn&rsquo;t do anything. Seems to me, colonel, you
shouldn&rsquo;t have allowed that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes me so mad,&rdquo; was the
bluff response of the guest. &ldquo;It was just
after crossing the creek to the southwest,
which doesn&rsquo;t lie in your way. A lot of the
beasts took fright at something, and away
they went on a bee line for Arizona. I
thought a couple of the boys would be able
to bring them back, and I sent them off,
while the other four looked after the main
herd. Thank you,&rdquo; said the colonel, as he
took the hot coffee from the hand of his
host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I judge from what you said, they
didn&rsquo;t bring back the hoofs,&rdquo; observed the
captain, interested in the narrative of his
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, by George, it was worse than that.
Three or four hours after the stampede, one
of the men came in sight, riding like mad.
There were no cattle with him, and he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
alone. I saw that one of his hands was bleeding
badly, and he had a woful story to tell.
He said he and the other fellow were working
like the mischief to turn the animals back,
and had almost succeeded, when the first they
knew a dozen whooping Comanches were right
upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was bang, bang, shoot, cut, yell, and
whoop her up again, with no thought of doing
anything but save themselves. The other
chap fought like a Trojan, but his horse was
killed and he went down with half the fiends
on him, fighting as long as the breath
remained in his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one who came back with the news
was pretty badly cut up and had the closest
kind of a call, but his horse was better
than any of the others and he managed to
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was idle to think of getting
your cattle after that,&rdquo; remarked the
captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so infuriated that I gathered the
rest of the men, intending to take the trail,
but by the time I was ready, I became cooler,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
and saw it would never do. Haven&rsquo;t you
been troubled with the redskins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the manner that you have, but
they stirred things up for us last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, Captain Shirril gave an account
of his own experience in his cabin. His
friend listened attentively to his story, for
it was interesting. He remarked, at its conclusion,
that the Indians had been more troublesome
that spring than he had ever known
them. Twice, within the preceding month,
they attempted to steal a number of his cattle,
but failed in each instance, with the loss of
several of their warriors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in my opinion we are likely to have
more trouble before we get through the Indian
country,&rdquo; added the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too; it will be well for us to
get not too far from each other, for we ought
to be in shape to give mutual support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; there must be other droves
on the march, and we ought to get a twist
on them that will make them squeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The supper being finished, the two leading
cattlemen sat down under the shelter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
of the covered wagon and smoked their
pipes. They had been old army officers,
though Colonel Sclevinger fought on the
Union side in the war. The singular feature
(and yet it was not so singular either), was
that they had come in contact more than once
during that period. It fell to the lot of the
colonel to take the captain prisoner. He
treated the brave Texan with so much consideration
that a strong friendship was
formed, which remained uninterrupted to
the present time.</p>
<p>It was by Captain Shirril&rsquo;s invitation that
Colonel Sclevinger came to Texas on the
return of peace. The Northern man felt an
interest in the ranch business, but followed
the counsel of the Texan, who warned him
against going blindly into it. He took pains
to give him points, and, when the proper time
arrived, helped him to that extent that the
gentleman avoided the disastrous blunders
committed by those who fancy the ranch
business offers a straight avenue to wealth,
without any preliminary training in its many
difficulties.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>Enough has been told to explain the friendship
between the two men. The colonel
intended to make only a brief call, but he so
enjoyed the company of his old friend that
he sat a long time in the wagon, smoking and
exchanging reminiscences of the war times,
which theme must ever be deeply entertaining
to those who were actors in that tremendous
epoch of our nation&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Finally the visitor bade his friend good-night,
and, mounting his horse, galloped off
in the night.</p>
<p>Avon Burnet had listened to a part of the
conversation, for he was always interested in
what this occasional visitor to their cabin had
to say, but he could not remain as long as he
wished. It was arranged that he should
assume his place in helping to watch the herd,
Ballyhoo Gleeson being one of those sharing
the duty with him.</p>
<p>So it was that the youth rode out in the dismal
rainy night to make a &ldquo;full hand&rdquo; at the
calling of a cattleman.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h3>A SHOT FROM THE DARKNESS.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was singular that Avon Burnet&rsquo;s most
humiliating experience overtook him on
his first night in helping to watch his uncle&rsquo;s
herd of cattle, while following the Great
Cattle Trail toward Kansas.</p>
<p>The starting point was so far north in
Texas that the first day carried them close to
the Indian Nation, through whose territory
they expected to tramp for several days.</p>
<p>The night, as has been explained, was raw,
with a fine, misty rain and a cutting wind.
The youth was seated on his fleet-footed and
intelligent Thunderbolt, with his back to the
wind, after the fashion not only of all cowboys,
under such circumstances, but of the
animals themselves, who sometimes drift
many miles before a driving storm.</p>
<p>He had his thick army blanket gathered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
about his body and shoulders, and, though
the night was dismal and his situation far
from pleasant, it still lacked the discomfort of
many hours spent on the vast plains of the
Lone Star State.</p>
<p>The young man had held his position for
less than an hour when the wind changed,
veering completely around, so that, instead
of being in front of the herd and edging
gradually from it, he was thrown behind
the cattle, for they immediately faced about
and began moving away from him.</p>
<p>The situation of the young herdsman
became a delicate one at once. His proper
place was in front, and to reach that point,
he must ride around the animals, and not
among them. One of the many singular
features of herding and driving cattle is the
wonderful sensitiveness shown at times by
them. While there is nothing extraordinary
in the wild panic often created by a
thunderstorm, there are occasions when a
whole herd is stampeded by a cause too
trifling to be understood.</p>
<p>Our experience leads us to agree with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
many veteran cowboys that the cattle, when
lying on the ground asleep, are sometimes
troubled with bad dreams which cause such
fright on their part that their excitement
becomes contagious. Then again the electrical
conditions produce a morbid uneasiness
among them as well as among men,
and there seem to be times when they are
simply awaiting a pretext for dashing off
in uncontrollable panic.</p>
<p>Avon Burnet&rsquo;s fear was that if he rode
directly after the cattle, the sound of his
mustang&rsquo;s hoofs would cause alarm, since it
was too dark for them to identify him. A
stampede is the terror of the cowmen&rsquo;s life,
and no labor or trouble is too great to avert
it. He, therefore, checked Thunderbolt and
waited a few minutes until the cattle were
so far off that he could wheel and gallop
around their flank without frightening
them.</p>
<p>When he thought sufficient time had
elapsed, he decided to wait a brief while
longer. His dread of a stampede was so
strong that he was unusually careful, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
with no thought of shirking any duty, he
twitched the reins of his horse, spoke
sharply, and without touch of spur, was
off like an arrow.</p>
<p>Although not an animal was visible, the
rider had the contour of the herd so vividly
impressed on his mind that he felt no misgiving,
when he began edging his steed more to
the left, and finally brought him to a stand-still,
as he believed, at the very front of the
collection. Indeed, his confidence would not
have been greater had the sun been shining.</p>
<p>But when he halted and listened he failed to
hear anything of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have ridden too far ahead,&rdquo; was
his conclusion, as he started his horse on a
walk to meet them; &ldquo;but they are surely
near by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed, and then
he drew rein with an exclamation of amazement,
for his keen sense of hearing did not
catch the first sound of the cattle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have lost the herd!&rdquo; he muttered in
dismay, and such was the fact. His cheeks
burned with chagrin at the consciousness of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
what at first thought seems an impossible
error on the part of man or youth with any
experience in attending cattle.</p>
<p>It was Avon&rsquo;s first mishap of the kind, and
he felt as though he could never face his comrades
again, if they should discover the blunder,
which, after all, was not so striking, when
the attendant circumstances are borne in
mind.</p>
<p>But if excuse could be accepted for his
slip, there was none for inaction after its
discovery. It was not to be supposed that the
animals would set out to hunt him, nor that
any knowledge could be gained of them by
idleness. There were other men on duty, and
he shouted at the top of his voice, in the hope
of receiving a response, but there was none.</p>
<p>Slipping from his saddle, he knelt down
and placed his ear to the ground. He fancied
he detected faint sounds, such as are made by
multitudinous hoofs on the soft, wet earth,
but the noises were so slight that he could
not identify the direction whence they came,
and he hastily climbed into the saddle again.</p>
<p>He realized that he was lost, and well aware
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
that at such times it is useless to puzzle one&rsquo;s
brains about the point of the compass, he
dashed in the direction which seemed to be
the right one. Of course, as in his recent
experience, it proved to be wrong, and he now
spurred toward the top of the ridge or hill,
which it was easy to identify under the tread
of his mustang. He was confident that this
elevation would yield the key to the situation
and he was not mistaken.</p>
<p>From the crest he observed the starlike
glimmer of a lantern, and no sight, except
that of the herd itself, could have been more
welcome. It was the signal suspended every
night from the front bow of the wagon, to
guide the men whenever they needed
guidance.</p>
<p>Confident that someone would be found at
that point who could give him the important
news he was seeking, Avon rode thither on a
dead run. He saw no one stirring as he
galloped up. The cook, who had charge of
the wagon, was asleep, and the men off duty
were slumbering soundly, while the chance
was theirs.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>But young Burnet had scarcely checked his
mustang, when the sound of someone riding
his horse equally fast reached his ear, and
the next instant Oscar Gleeson dashed beside
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Baby, is that you?&rdquo; he asked,
peering at the young man dimly seen in the
scant yellow rays of the lantern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ballyhoo,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost the herd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Texan shook in his saddle with
laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me, too; the first thing I knowed
they was gone. I yelled for you, but you
couldn&rsquo;t have heard me, and, after cantering
round awhile, I struck for the wagon in quest
of news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avon drew a sigh of relief, and with a
smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you lost them, for the boys
won&rsquo;t laugh at you, while they would at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anyone in that
crowd that will laugh, for they all had the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
same experience. I know Old Bronze and
Short Stop have lost a herd more than once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do to stay here,&rdquo; remarked Avon,
&ldquo;for you know there is another herd only a
mile off, and if the two become mixed, it will
be a big job to cut out ours to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; replied Gleeson, &ldquo;if
the cattle have gone back to the bed-ground;
at any rate we&rsquo;ll look for them there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The return to the wagon enabled the couple
to obtain their bearings, and they knew the
proper course to reach the spot, but the possibility
of the theory being wrong caused them
to separate, so as to proceed thither by routes
which, while substantially parallel, were so
far apart that they were out of each other&rsquo;s
sight and hearing, the latter being chiefly due
to the direction of the wind.</p>
<p>Avon spurred Thunderbolt into an easy
canter, the soft grass making the travel easy,
though there was always the risk of his
animal sinking one or more of his hoofs into a
hole, with the prospect of a broken leg for the
horse and a dislocated neck for his rider.</p>
<p>When it seemed to the latter that he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
passed the intervening distance, he drew his
mustang to a walk, listening and peering
through the gloom with all the power at his
command. There was no lighting of the
darkness, the wind still blew keenly, and the
fine drizzling rain continued.</p>
<p>No sight nor sound came to him, and, once
more bringing his animal to a halt, he dismounted
and pressed his ear to the ground.</p>
<p>This time he caught a distinct noise: it was
that made by the hoofs of a horse. He was
walking, and was so near that Thunderbolt
pricked his ears and uttered a faint whinny
of salutation. Avon instantly rose to his feet,
and remounted.</p>
<p>Looking keenly into the wet darkness, he
became aware that a horse was standing
motionless but a short distance off on his left.
In the gloom the outlines could be traced,
but so dimly that he was uncertain whether
he had a rider or not. The steed held his
head well up like Thunderbolt, and appeared
to be scrutinizing the youth and his animal
with a curiosity equal to theirs.</p>
<p>There was something so impressive in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
sight of the statue-like object, which emitted
not the slightest sound, that young Burnet
hesitated whether to advance or to await its
approach. The man could not be Gleeson,
and, whoever he was, it was evident that he
regarded Avon with inquiring suspicion.</p>
<p>But unwilling to maintain the trying situation,
the latter touched the neck of his mustang
in a way which the animal recognized
as a command to move forward very slowly.
He obeyed, and had advanced but a few short
steps when Avon to his astonishment perceived
that the strange horse was without a
rider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that,&rdquo; mused the
mystified young man, stopping his own animal,
with several yards separating them; &ldquo;he
must have an owner, and what can have
become of him, and why is&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant he observed a suspicious
movement, seemingly from the other side of
the steed. Before he could divine its nature,
a rifle was discharged almost in his face and
he went off his mustang like a flash.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<h3>SHACKAYE, THE COMANCHE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Avon Burnet was in the act of lifting
his Winchester from across the front of
his saddle, when he made the discovery that,
although the strange mustang in front of him
bore no rider, yet a man was on the ground
directly beyond and evidently watching every
movement made by himself.</p>
<p>This discovery could mean but one thing:
the individual was an enemy, and was on the
point of making a hostile movement against
him. He had undoubtedly dismounted on
learning of Burnet&rsquo;s approach and interposed
his steed between them. Despite the gloom on
every hand, Avon read aright the meaning of
the almost imperceptible movement on the
other side of the saddle, and he slipped from
the back of his mustang with a celerity which,
being displayed almost at the instant of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
discharge of the other weapon, looked as if
it was the result of a fatal shot.</p>
<p>But, although the bullet so treacherously
fired came near its mark, the youth was not
touched. His action was in the nick of time:
a second later could not have availed him.</p>
<p>He was incensed, as he had the best cause
for being, and he resolved that the miscreant
should not escape him. His rifle was snatched
from its resting-place, and, stepping from
behind Thunderbolt, he drew the best bead
possible on his foe.</p>
<p>The dexterity of the latter was marvellous.
It was as if, at the very instant of discharging
his weapon, he had vaulted into the saddle,
and, wheeling the head of his horse away,
sent him scurrying straight from his intended
victim.</p>
<p>Not only that, but, in accordance with the
fashion of the frontier in such emergencies,
he flung himself forward on the neck of his
animal, so as to offer the least possible target
to the other, who, if not hit hard, was certain
to return the shot.</p>
<p>The curious feature of the proceeding was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
that the man, having seen the youth vanish
from the back of his steed at the instant the
gun was discharged, did not assume that he
was killed. Possibly such was his supposition,
and his hasty flight was partly due to
his anxiety to place himself beyond reach of
his friends, who were likely to be drawn
thither by the sound of firing. His act in
throwing himself upon the neck of his mustang
was simply in obedience to the rule
which requires the frontiersman to avail himself
of every possible means of safety, even
when there is seemingly no call for it.</p>
<p>Despite the quickness of young Burnet, he
was able to bring his Winchester to a level
only at the moment the steed was thundering
out of sight in the darkness, but he <a name='TC_5'></a><ins class="tnchg" title="Was 'left' in original text">let</ins> fly
three times in rapid succession, reckless
whether he struck rider or animal; but since
the sound of the hoofs still came to him, he
was chagrined at the conviction that he had
missed both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t escaped me yet,&rdquo; he
muttered, swinging himself into the saddle;
&ldquo;there is no horse in Texas or the Indian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
Nation that can leave me behind; now,
Thunderbolt, run him down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, while the fates had been kind to Avon,
in that he escaped death by the narrowest
conceivable chance, they seemed equally well
disposed toward the object of his wrath.
The boast of the pursuer as to the fleetness
of his mustang was warranted, and had the
circumstances continued favorable for only
a few minutes, he would have brought his
young rider beside the fleeing steed, where
the account between the two men must have
been quickly settled.</p>
<p>But at the very moment of starting, the
forelegs of Thunderbolt sank into a hole
above the knees. His activity saved him
from harm, but his rider took a header over
his ears, sprawling on the wet grass in front
with a shock that stunned him.</p>
<p>By the time he could rally and remount
his mustang, the other was not only beyond
sight, but his listening ear could not detect
the slightest sound of the flying hoofs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has escaped this time,&rdquo; thought Avon,
as he once more resumed his place in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
saddle, &ldquo;but the account is still open and
must be settled very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was right, except that the account was
closed not only sooner than he suspected, but
in a manner of which he never dreamed.</p>
<p>Despite his alarming experience he had not
lost his reckoning, and, facing toward the bed-ground
of the herd, he had ridden but a short
way, when the familiar sounds told him he
was near the animals from which he was lost
only a short time before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are here, Baby, just as I thought.&rdquo;
The remark was made by Gleeson, who
loomed up in the gloom as he spoke, with his
mustang on a deliberate walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad of that, and, since no one beside
you and me knows of our slip last night,
we&rsquo;ll keep it to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no objection; but didn&rsquo;t I hear a gun
go off a few minutes ago? What was you
shooting at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t <i>I</i>&ndash;&ndash;someone shot at <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereupon Avon related the particulars
of his encounter with the treacherous horseman.
Gleeson listened and said nothing until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
he had finished. Then, with a characteristic
exclamation, he expressed his regret that
Thunderbolt should have stumbled as he
did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your eyes open,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
do the same, and we&rsquo;ll get the drop on him
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does he want to hurt <i>me</i>?&rdquo; asked
Avon, &ldquo;when there has never been a word
between us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the nature of the animal,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have made any difference
whether it was you or me, so he
thought he had a sure thing of it. That&rsquo;s
what he&rsquo;s here for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident from these words that each
of the speakers was satisfied as to the identity
of the one that had fired the well-nigh
fatal shot. Gleeson named him immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warned the cap, when he hired that
Comanche, that we would have trouble with
him. We left Texas a little short-handed,
but we could have got through well enough
without him. Howsumever, Shackaye, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
you remember, rode into camp one day
and asked the cap to give him a job, and
the cap done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recall your words about him, and I
thought they were not justified; but what
made you so suspicious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Texan uttered an impatient exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place he&rsquo;s an Injin, and <i>that</i>
ought to be enough. I never seen one of
his race that it&rsquo;s safe to trust; they&rsquo;ll shoot
the man that gives them a cup of water or
a piece of bread. Talk about Injin gratitude!
There aint any such thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did my uncle say to your sentiments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He laughed in that quiet way of his, and
said maybe as I was right, but he didn&rsquo;t see
what we had to fear from one Injin that was
in camp with us; he reckoned we could pull
his teeth before he could bite enough to hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure he will think differently when
he hears my story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell him or anyone else a word
about it. Promise me that.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo; asked the surprised Avon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; was the hesitating answer, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
several reasons: one of them is that though
you and me have fixed on the Comanche as
the chap, we aint sure of it. It looks very
much that way, but it may be someone else
after all. We mustn&rsquo;t make any mistake, and
above all, don&rsquo;t let Shackaye think we suspect
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth gave his promise, though in his
mind there was no doubt of the identity
of the man that had come so near shooting
him from his mustang. He saw the wisdom
of not allowing Shackaye to know that he
was suspected.</p>
<p>The cattle having been located, the couple
had little to do but to hold them where
they were. This proved less difficult than
at other times. They had the help of Burrell,
or Old Bronze, in the work, and the
three did little but ride back and forth,
timing their course in such a way that they
skirted the large body of animals, often meeting
and exchanging greetings, but more often
passing without seeming to see each other.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>Sometimes one of the cattle would show
a determination to dash away from the
main body, but before he went far, a horseman
was in front of him and he was forced
back. The night was too chilly for sleeping,
else one or more of the herders would
have stretched out on the damp earth, with
his bridle reins so interlocked with his arm
that his horse could not wander off, or he
would have fallen asleep in his saddle.
When worn out with fatigue and loss of
slumber, a cowboy often rides for miles
totally unconscious of what is going on
around him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<h3>A MISHAP.</h3>
</div>
<p>The weather cleared toward morning,
and the sun rose without a cloud obscuring
its face. The halt had been made
along a small tributary of the Wichita,
whose upper waters flow through the country
of the Kiowas, Comanches, and Apaches,
that of the Cheyennes and Arapahoes lying
further north.</p>
<p>The scene was inspiriting. The cowboys
gathered around the wagon for breakfast,
the cook having been thoughtful enough to
protect the wood against the rain. The
animals were busy cropping the grass, which
was rich and succulent on all sides of the
Trail, the hands for the time being bestowing
only general attention on them, but
everyone was ready to leap into the saddle
and dash off at a instant&rsquo;s call.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></div>
<p>Captain Shirril discovered that a bunch of
thirty cattle were missing, and believed they
had joined his friend&rsquo;s herd a mile to the
southward, from which it would be necessary
to separate or cut them out.</p>
<p>Antonio Nunez, the Mexican, and Shackaye,
the Comanche (the latter of whom showed no
evidence of having been engaged in questionable
business during the preceding night),
were similarly attired, though it would be
supposed that the full-blooded Indian would
have dressed in accordance with the fashion
of his people. He claimed, however, to have
been engaged in the cattle business before,
and, when he first presented himself in camp
on his wiry pony, he wore the broad-brimmed
sombrero, baggy leather breeches, and red
sash around his waist, which were the most
noticeable features of the Mexican&rsquo;s make-up.</p>
<p>The Comanche, however, used no spurs, his
feet being shod with moccasins, and, instead
of the revolver worn by the Mexicans, he
carried a knife thrust in at his girdle and a
breech-loading rifle, which was not repeating.</p>
<p>The cowboys sported the same broad-brimmed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
hats, which in some instances cost
more than all the rest of their suits, the
leggings, flannel overshirts, and gaudy handkerchiefs
tied loosely around their necks.</p>
<p>All, as a matter of course, were expert
horsemen, and were furnished with two or
three excellent animals apiece, for their
business is as trying upon them as upon the
men.</p>
<p>The meal was quickly finished, and Captain
Shirril, with two of his hands, set out for the
camp to the rear, where he hoped to find the
missing cattle. Since there was a possibility
that they had strayed in other directions,
three more men were despatched to make
search.</p>
<p>It was rather curious that the captain
selected as his assistants his nephew Avon and
the young Comanche Shackaye. When they
were riding off, Gleeson, the Texan, looked at
the youth and winked, but said nothing.</p>
<p>Half-way to the camp, the three galloped
over a ridge or swell in the prairie, when to
their surprise they came upon the missing
animals browsing just beyond.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s lucky!&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;the
job is going to be easier than I supposed.
Avon, you and Shackaye ride to the left, while
I will turn to the right. Look out for that
ugly steer; we have had trouble with him
before, and I believe he is in a bad mood
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian grinned on hearing these words
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me no &rsquo;fraid; me rope him if he fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to show his contempt for the huge
brute, he drove his mustang straight for him
as he was grazing on the further side of the
group. The steer raised his head, with the
grass hanging from his jaws, and looked
quietly at the approaching Indian. He
seemed to be in doubt as to his purpose, until
Shackaye, when almost upon him, swung his
arm above his head and uttered a tantalizing
shout, as if he wished to enrage the beast.</p>
<p>If such was his purpose he succeeded, for
with a muttered bellow, the steer dropped his
head and charged fiercely at the pony, which,
to save himself, was obliged to wheel with
such suddenness that the young Comanche,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
despite his superb horsemanship, was thrown
violently to the ground directly in front of the
animal.</p>
<p>Occasionally a cowboy is caught in the
perilous situation of the young Comanche.
His horse may stumble, his lasso (always
called a &ldquo;rope&rdquo; except in California) become
entangled, or he may be thrown to the ground
in the path of the charging steer or bull,
which is sure to be upon him before he can
regain his feet and steed.</p>
<p>In such emergencies there is but the single
thing to do: that is, to shoot the animal, and
to hesitate to do so means certain death to the
endangered cattleman.</p>
<p>Two causes prevented Shackaye from
appealing to this last and only recourse. His
fall was so violent that he was slightly dazed,
though he did not lose sight of his peril, but
he made the mistake of attempting to climb to
his feet and darting aside, when the time at
command was insufficient to take him beyond
reach of the savage steer.</p>
<p>His rifle remained in place on the front of
his saddle, so that it was beyond his reach,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
while, as I have stated elsewhere, he carried
no pistol. He was, therefore, without firearms.</p>
<p>Captain Shirril was fully two hundred
yards away, but he saw the imminence of the
danger, and, bringing his gun to a level, fired
at the steer, calling at the same moment to
his nephew to shoot it. The captain&rsquo;s bullet
struck the beast, but without producing any
effect, unless to add to his rage.</p>
<p>It took Avon but a second or two to raise
his Winchester to his shoulder and aim at the
animal, which was near at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was sure that was you last night,&rdquo;
he thought, &ldquo;I would let the steer do his
duty, but maybe you are innocent, so here
goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no special feat of marksmanship to
send a rifle-ball through the heart of the
charging brute, but he was so close to the
Comanche when he received the shot that he
would have tumbled over him, had not
Shackaye managed to roll aside in time to
avoid the huge mass, which ploughed along
the ground, as if fired from an enormous
gun.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>The occurrence alarmed the other cattle, and
they started off at such a pace that the instant
attention of the captain and his nephew was
required. Paying no further heed to the
unhorsed Shackaye, Avon sent his mustang
after the flying animals, the captain doing the
same from his direction.</p>
<p>The hardest of riding was required to round
them up and turn their faces toward the main
herd, and it was not long before Avon found
himself pitted against a steer fully as ugly as
that which he had been obliged to shoot a few
minutes before. All the others were finally
forced into the right course, and this obstinate
animal was disposed to join them, but after
trotting for a short distance, he seemed to tire
of being good, and, wheeling about, charged
like a runaway engine at the youthful horseman
who was harrying him so hard.</p>
<p>In such crises a great deal depends on the
intelligence of the horse. Thunderbolt sprang
aside with the nimbleness of a monkey, and
Avon received just enough warning to hold
his place in the saddle. The steer attempted
to keep up his pursuit, turning with remarkable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
quickness for such a large animal, but
the dexterity of Thunderbolt was still greater,
and he easily evaded the sharp horns which
came near him more than once. Finally, as if
he saw the uselessness of his pursuit, the steer
headed in the opposite direction from that
which he ought to have taken, and sped away
with all the fleetness he possessed.</p>
<p>Avon saw his uncle galloping to his help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him to me!&rdquo; called the nephew;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll conquer him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Shirril drew up, and, from his
perch in the saddle, watched the result of the
curious contest.</p>
<p>Avon had his rope ready to fling over the
horns of the fugitive, but before doing so, he
resorted to another artifice, which few persons
of his years can carry out successfully. It
is not only difficult, but it is vastly more
dangerous, in the event of the animal showing
fight, as the steer had already done.</p>
<p>It was necessary to force Thunderbolt close
beside the fugitive, and, despite the courage
of the mustang, it was only natural that he
should feel some reluctance against doing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
this. Those horns possessed prodigious
length and sharpness, and had already been
turned upon him; but he was obedient, and
urged by the pricking of the spur and the
words of his master, he edged still nearer,
though it need not be said that he kept an eye
to windward. It was well he did so.</p>
<p>Young Burnet was in the act of leaning forward
to attempt the dangerous and difficult
feat, when the steer again dropped his head,
with one side lower than the other, as such
animals do when assailing a foe sideways,
and charged upon the mustang.</p>
<p>Nine horses out of ten would have been
fatally impaled by the suddenness of the assault,
for there was no time for him to wheel;
but with a dexterity that seemed incredible,
he instantly rose on his hind feet and bounded
clean over the steer. The wonder of the
exploit was how the horse gathered himself
and applied his strength with such astonishing
quickness, but he did it like a trained gymnast,
his rider maintaining his seat without difficulty
and feeling a thrill of admiration at the
amazing skill of his steed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>If a dumb animal can ever show surprise,
the steer displayed it at the action of the mustang.
Having made his lunge with his horns,
he must have become aware that, instead of
piercing flesh and blood, they clove vacancy
only. With his head aloft, and snorting with
anger, he stared where the horse and rider
were a moment before, but where now they
were not.</p>
<p>He looked to the right and left, as if unable
to comprehend what had become of
them. Captain Shirril was seated motionless
on his steed, several hundred yards distant,
and, if the steer decided for a moment
in his own mind that he was the individual
he was looking for, he must have been puzzled
to know how it was his horse traveled
so far in such an amazingly brief space of
time.</p>
<p>The sound of hoofs caused the animal to
look on the other side of him, where, sure
enough, only a short distance off was the
identical offender, calmly surveying him as if
plotting further mischief.</p>
<p>Instantly the head of the steer dropped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
again, and he was in the act of charging with
the same impetuosity as before, when he
changed his mind, and, instead of becoming
a pursuer, resumed the character of a
fugitive.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<h3>OLD ACQUAINTANCES.</h3>
</div>
<p>Without hesitation the mustang was
after the stubborn steer again, showing
less fear than before, though he maintained
a sharp lookout against a repetition of
the attack. It may have been that the dexterous
manner in which he had just eluded
the brute gave him self-confidence, as it
weakened that of the fugitive without lessening
his obduracy, for he took care that the
line of his flight led straight away from his
own herd.</p>
<p>With the same care Thunderbolt began
edging up, and, in a brief while, his head
was abreast of the haunch of the steer, and
steadily gaining. Avon now leaned over the
right shoulder of his mustang, and reaching
forward and downward, seized the tail of the
steer, and in a flash twisted all that was sufficiently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
flexible around the horn of his saddle.
At the same instant he called sharply to
Thunderbolt, who made a vicious bound to
the left, and the steer, with a short bellow of
pain, went down with fearful violence.</p>
<p>But he was not yet conquered. As full of
energy and obstinacy as ever, he seemed to
leap to his feet as if made of rubber, but without
attempting to resent the indignity he had
suffered, he continued his impetuous flight.</p>
<p>The brief interval had given Avon time in
which to uncoil his rope. Instead of flinging
it over the horns of the steer he dexterously
caught the loop around one of his hind legs,
and jerked it taut with the quickness of lightning.
Down went the animal again, kicking
and bellowing and struggling hard to regain
his feet.</p>
<p>The youth allowed him to succeed, when,
with the help of the mustang, he was thrown
again. This was repeated several times, until
it was apparent that the captive was subdued.
Finally, after receiving another fall, he
refused to try to regain his feet.</p>
<p>Avon now managed to loosen the loop sufficiently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
to slip it off the imprisoned leg.
Then, holding several coils in his grasp, he
reached over and gave the panting animal
several resounding whacks on his ribs.</p>
<p>He smiled as the brute hastily clambered
up, and, turning his nose toward the other
cattle a considerable distance off, broke into a
trot after them, still bellowing as if asking
them to wait until he could join them. No
refractory urchin was ever brought to terms
with more completeness than was the defiant
steer.</p>
<p>Now that the disciplined animal was travelling
in the right direction, his conqueror also
faced Captain Shirril, who had been watching
him with much interest, while the cattle were
stringing along at a rapid gallop in the direction
of the ridge beyond which lay the
invisible camp of the cowmen.</p>
<p>The lull in the stirring proceeding led Avon
to recall the mishap of Shackaye, who had
escaped the horns of the other steer by such a
narrow chance. He cast his eye toward the
body of the dead animal plainly seen across
the prairie, but the young Comanche himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
was not in sight. He concluded that he must
have remounted his mustang and galloped
back to camp. Possibly he had received some
injury from his fall which placed it beyond
his power to help in the work of gathering the
stray members of the herd.</p>
<p>Avon turned his attention to his relative,
when he was astonished to perceive fully a
dozen horsemen a short distance off between
him and the ridge.</p>
<p>The first natural thought of the youth was
that the party at the camp had ridden out to
their help, but he instantly saw that such
could not be the case, since there were so
many of them, and it did not require a second
glance to ascertain that each one was a
mounted Indian.</p>
<p>The first emotion following this discovery
was that of a wonderment as to what it could
all mean. It was not remarkable that they
should encounter Indians, while crossing the
section set apart especially for their occupancy,
nor was anything to be feared from
them unless the temptation to violence became
unusually strong on the part of the red men.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></div>
<p>But there was something ominous in the
sudden and singular appearance of these dusky
plainsmen. They had shown up unexpectedly,
the indication being that they had emerged
from a group of hills a short distance to the
eastward. Colonel Sclevinger and his herd
were beyond sight, so that the two friends
were in anything but a pleasant situation.</p>
<p>But while it looked as if the Indians must
be friendly from force of circumstances, their
conduct justified the grave alarm Avon felt on
first seeing them. Perceiving they were discovered,
they broke into a rapid gallop beyond
the unsuspicious Captain Shirril, spreading
apart like a fan, as if they meant to inclose
him in the circle beyond escape.</p>
<p>A shout from the young man caused his
uncle to look around, when he discovered
what was going on. He instantly touched
his animal with his spurs and sent him
swiftly toward Avon, who advanced to meet
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; asked the younger
as they came together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means mischief,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
believe some of them belong to the party that
tried to burn our house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they are Comanches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one of them&ndash;&ndash;where&rsquo;s Shackaye?&rdquo;
abruptly asked the captain, as if the naming
of the tribe had recalled that interesting
youth to his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he were among
them,&rdquo; replied Avon, with a certain grim
pleasure, as he recalled the faith his uncle
had shown in the savage in the face of Gleeson&rsquo;s
warnings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like enough,&rdquo; remarked the captain,
watching the actions of the warriors, who had
diverged so far already that it was impossible
for the couple to escape in any direction without
coming in collision with them; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
got to stand them off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without any appearance of alarm in his
manner Captain Shirril slipped down from his
saddle, his nephew being but a few seconds
behind him, and the two coolly prepared to
make a stand against the attack of the
Comanches.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<h3>AT BAY.</h3>
</div>
<p>Captain Shirril and his nephew
placed their ponies beside each other,
with a space of only a few feet intervening.
Then, standing on the ground, they rested
their Winchesters across the saddles, facing in
opposite directions, and were ready for the
assault of the red men, who were circling back
and forth and gradually drawing nearer to
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep cool,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;and, when
you fire, don&rsquo;t throw away a shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were a mile from camp, and, as soon
as the shooting began, it ought to attract the
notice of the rest, who were sure to hurry to
the spot. There was reason to believe the
Indians could be held off for a long time, and,
brave as they were, it was not to be expected
that they would maintain their ground before
such a charge as the cowboys would make,
and had made a short time before.</p>
<div class='figtag'>

<span class='smcap'>The Last Stand.</span><br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></div>
<p>The warriors were armed with excellent
rifles, and belonged to a tribe that is unsurpassable
in horsemanship. Several had
blankets on their mustangs, but most were
without even that protection, being bareback,
while few possessed anything in the nature of
a bridle. The well-trained steeds, as we have
shown, were perfectly managed by word and
touch, and often seemed to divine the wishes
of their riders, without word or movement on
their part.</p>
<p>But, daring as were the latter, they knew
the peril involved in assailing two well-armed
white men at bay. They continued their
rapid galloping at a safe distance, some of
them describing a complete circle around the
couple, who were quietly awaiting the chances
for effective work.</p>
<p>Before long the assailants began operations.
Hardly one retained an upright position
on his steed for more than a few seconds
at a time. They flung themselves forward, as
if in wantonness, their painted faces appearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
below their horses&rsquo; necks, with their long
black hair streaming away, as if it were a part
of the mane of their steeds. Then they
extended themselves seemingly along the
spine of their animals, as if for slumber in the
sun. While the steeds sped back and forth,
the riders lolled here and there on their
backs, as though it was impossible for them
to lose their balance. Trying as were the
circumstances, Captain Shirril could not help
admiring the equestrian exhibition, which
could not have been excelled.</p>
<p>But he quickly proved that he meant business
of the most serious kind. He fixed his
attention on one of the half-naked miscreants,
who was not only nearer than any of his companions,
but kept edging closer. For a time,
he maintained himself on the further side of
his mustang, seeming to hold himself in place
by the toe of one of his moccasins thrust over
the spine at the haunches, with hardly less
significant help from a hand at the base of the
neck.</p>
<p>When the horse wheeled to return over his
own trail, as he frequently did, the matchless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
rider, with a grace that was inimitable, swung
himself over in a corresponding position on
the other side, so as to preserve the body of
his steed as a shield.</p>
<p>Without warning, he discharged his rifle
from beneath the neck of the animal, and the
excellence of his aim was proven by the whiz
of the bullet near the head of Captain Shirril.</p>
<p>But the latter was not disturbed. He was
biding his time, and knew the opportunity
was near.</p>
<p>Suddenly the mustang wheeled again. At
the moment of doing so, he was closer to the
defenders than at any period before. The
rider rose to view for a moment, like a leaper
going over a fence sideways. Then as he
descended on the other side of the steed, he
continued descending until he struck the
ground, where he rolled over a single time
and never stirred again.</p>
<p>At the critical instant, Captain Shirril had
fired. An ear-splitting screech followed, and
that particular Comanche was eliminated from
the problem that confronted him.</p>
<p>The riderless horse flung up his head, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
a whinny of affright, and, looking hither and
thither, as if unable to understand the meaning
of the occurrence, dashed off to join his
companions, further away on the prairie.</p>
<p>The thin puff of smoke had not lifted from
before the captain&rsquo;s face, when his nephew let
fly at one of the warriors, who was extended
along the back of his animal, as if inviting
a shot. Avon missed, and the Indian, with
astonishing quickness, brought his own gun
to a level and fired in return. The ball
nipped the brim of his sombrero, passing so
close that for a second the youth believed he
was hit.</p>
<p>The situation was growing serious, and,
since this particular Comanche was so defiant,
Avon decided that the occasion was a good
one for the use of a repeating weapon. Without
pausing to take special aim, he fired three
times in rapid succession at his foe.</p>
<p>Though the latter escaped for the moment,
his steed was less fortunate. He was hit hard
by the first shot, while the last brought him
to earth with a bullet through his brain.</p>
<p>His rider was too nimble to be caught by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
the fall, but, leaping clear, ran swiftly across
the plain in the effort to get beyond reach of
the rifle, which seemed to be raining bullets
all around him. His courage had given place
to panic, and as he ran he bounded from side
to side and up and down with the grotesque
contortions of a Digger Indian when seeking
to baffle the aim of an enemy.</p>
<p>Avon continued his fusillade, and by a piece
of pure accident winged the fugitive. He
did not fall, but the height of his leap and the
resonance of his outcry, instantly succeeded
by a pronounced limp in his gait, left no
doubt that he had gotten in the path of the
hurtling messenger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you making out, Baby?&rdquo; asked
Captain <a name='TC_6'></a><ins class="tnchg" title="Was 'Shirrel' in original text">Shirril</ins>, turning his head and coolly
scrutinizing his relative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only fairly,&rdquo; replied Avon, replenishing
the magazine of his gun and keeping his gaze
on the plain in front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well enough to drop a mustang, but
it is better to tumble their riders off them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to do that, but failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The natural supposition of the friends was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
that the hot reception they had given their
assailants would check them, and cause their
withdrawal beyond the deadly range of their
Winchesters. The reports must have reached
the cowboys, and both glanced at the ridge to
the west, over which they expected to see
their comrades coming to their rescue.</p>
<p>But the Comanches could not have failed to
know of the presence of others near at hand,
which fact warned them that whatever they
did must be done quickly. Instead of falling
back, therefore, because of the loss of a single
warrior and steed, they rallied and pushed
the fight with greater vigor than ever.</p>
<p>In the face of the cracking Winchesters they
rode closer than before, and then branching
apart, put their animals on a run while they
discharged their guns from every conceivable
position. Instead of wheeling about as at
first, they kept them straight away on the
circle, which being less than before, enabled
them to circumnavigate the defenders in a
brief space of time.</p>
<p>The captain and his nephew had their hands
full, for assailants were on every side of them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
and the popping of their guns was continuous.
The attack was so serious, and the defenders
were in such a conspicuous position, that it
was impossible to escape the storm of bullets
flying all around them.</p>
<p>A quick start on the part of Thunderbolt
showed that he had been hit, while almost at
the same moment the rearing of the captain&rsquo;s
mustang proved that he, too, was hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make your horse lie down,&rdquo; called the
elder.</p>
<p>Avon had already determined on this recourse,
and seizing the head of his animal he
ordered him down. Thunderbolt was well
trained, but the hurt already received made
him restless, and his young master had to
engage in a partial struggle before he gathered
his legs under him and rolled over on his
side.</p>
<p>The instant he did so Avon knelt behind his
body and was in the most favorable posture
for defense.</p>
<p>Captain Shirril&rsquo;s task proved more difficult.
His horse refused to go down at his command,
and it was necessary to throw him. He resisted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
with such vigor that his owner dropped
his rifle and was forced to use his utmost
strength before he could trip and bring him to
the earth. He still fought, and the captain,
losing patience for the moment, forgot the
whistling missiles and gave his whole attention
to the brute, which he speedily conquered.</p>
<p>Avon was on the point of offering help, when
he perceived that the mustang was mastered,
and he once more turned to the enemy, now
pressing his advantage to the utmost.</p>
<p>The Comanches were so close, and the opportunity
for aiming effectively was so good, that
the shots of the youth began to tell. Had the
red men been compelled to maintain one position
in front, a single person with a repeating
Winchester could have stood off the whole
party; but, as has been explained, the Indians
were on every hand.</p>
<p>But Avon was not throwing away his cartridges.
The very first shot bored its way
through the bronzed skull of a shrieking warrior,
and the second slew his pony with such
suddenness that the two rolled together on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
plain, the warrior being unable to extricate
himself from beneath his struggling mustang.</p>
<p>The young man, finding no one in his immediate
front, turned toward a couple that were
advancing from another point, but before he
could make his aim sure, he was shocked to
hear a groan from Captain Shirril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hit?&rdquo; asked the nephew, turning
his scared face toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but still able to do something; bring
your horse to his feet and make a dash for the
camp. There isn&rsquo;t an earthly chance for us
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot leave you, uncle, and, if I
could it would be impossible to run the
gauntlet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our only hope; my horse is too badly
hurt to carry me off, but you may succeed,
if you ride hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; replied the nephew, who,
had the prospect been ten-fold more favorable,
could not have deserted his relative at
such a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; he exclaimed the next moment,
&ldquo;yonder come the boys!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></div>
<p>He had caught sight of their friends approaching
over the ridge, their animals on
a dead run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be too late,&rdquo; said Captain
Shirril, whose horse at that moment received
another shot and renewed his frantic struggles
to regain his feet. His owner interposed, but,
he, too, was wounded and unable to put forth
the strength that had conquered the brute a
moment before.</p>
<p>Avon would have gone to his help had
there been anything to gain by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he can do you no
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he can and he <i>shall</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, the captain whipped out his
revolver and drove a couple of bullets through
the brain of the mustang. He expected him
to drop dead on the instant, when he would
serve the purpose intended of a breastwork
for his master.</p>
<p>Avon had withdrawn his attention at the
critical moment, fearful that the Comanches,
realizing the straits of himself and companion,
would overwhelm them before resistance could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
be offered. Thus his head was turned away
from the mortally hurt horse of the captain,
which, instead of sinking helpless to the
earth, made a frantic leap and fell upon the
unprepared youth.</p>
<p>It seemed for the moment as if a mountain
had descended upon him. He struggled
fiercely to free himself, and in his desperate
effort worked his head and shoulders clear,
but while trying to draw his revolver for his
last defence, he succumbed. The sunlight
faded from before his eyes, all became blank
darkness, and consciousness departed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<h3>FLAG OF TRUCE.</h3>
</div>
<p>There was nothing to cause apprehension
on the part of the cowboys in camp,
when they heard the report of a single rifle
from beyond the ridge over which Captain
Shirril, Avon Burnet, and the young Comanche
Shackaye had ridden in pursuit of the cattle
that went astray the night before. One of the
party might have found a chance to bring
down something in the nature of game, which
is liable to be encountered at every part of the
Great Cattle Trail, from the outskirts of the
capital of Texas to its termination in the State
of Kansas.</p>
<p>But when, soon after, the shots came thick
and fast, it was apparent that something unusual
was going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s mischief afoot!&rdquo; called out Gleeson,
&ldquo;and that Comanche is at the bottom of
it. Come, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></div>
<p>There was not an instant&rsquo;s hesitation on the
part of any member of the company. The
cattle that were quietly browsing on the succulent
grass were left to wander off or stampede
themselves, or do whatever they chose,
while the cowboys, including Nunez, the Mexican,
swung into their saddles and sped away
on a dead run toward the ridge.</p>
<p>Before they reached it the missing cattle
came up from the other side and appeared on
the crest. The advent of the steer that had
suffered so severely at the hands of Avon
Burnet imparted a mild panic to the others,
so that the whole lot were on a trot. The
horsemen were in too great haste to turn aside,
and the animals, therefore, swerved to the
right and continued their brisk gait in the
direction of the main herd.</p>
<p>As has been said, every mustang was running
at the highest speed, but the impetuous
Gleeson maintained his place in front, and
thundered up the slope as if his own life were
at stake. Before he struck the crest, he rose
in his box-stirrups and peered over at the
plain beyond.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I expected!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;and that Shackaye has done it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not necessary to explain, for, before
he could have done so, his comrades caught
sight of the stirring scene which thrilled their
leader. Captain Shirril and his nephew were
standing off a party of dusky assailants, who
were pressing them hard. The two mustangs
were plainly seen, while the flashes of the
Winchesters from behind them told the story
as eloquently as if the cowboys were actual
participants in the affray.</p>
<p>Not another word was uttered by the latter,
but pressing their spurs deep into the flanks of
their horses they sent them with arrowy haste
straight toward the spot. They had hardly
reached the base of the slope when they held
their breath, for they saw the crisis had come.
The red men were closing around the two combatants
as if they realized that whatever was
to be accomplished must be done within the
succeeding few seconds.</p>
<p>Half the distance was passed, when the Comanches
were observed scurrying toward a
mass of hills hardly a half-mile distant. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
rode so closely that the cowboys failed to note
the momentous fact that they bore a prisoner
with them.</p>
<p>In such emergencies a party of American
Indians generally manage to carry off their
dead and wounded, but the haste was too
urgent in this case. The stark figures were
left stretched on the prairies where they had
fallen, and a number of animals also lay motionless
near. The wounded were taken care
of, but the dead were left to bury the dead.</p>
<p>The cowboys discharged a score of shots at
the Comanches, but the distance was too great
to accomplish anything, and, seeing that it
was impossible to overtake them before they
reached the shelter of the wooded hills, Gleeson
led the party toward the spot where they
believed their friends needed instant care.</p>
<p>The prostrate horses, and a partial glimpse
of a figure lying between them, caused the
rescuers to believe that the captain and his
nephew were either slain outright or badly
hurt.</p>
<p>The approaching mustangs kept up their
run until they were thrown on their haunches
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
with such suddenness that the shock seemed
to fling the riders from their saddles. They
leaped forward, and vigorous arms quickly
lifted the body of the captain&rsquo;s horse from off
young Burnet, who opened his eyes and
looked up with that faint wildness which
showed he had no conception of the
situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the question that was asked by
several, as all glared around for their leader.
Before anyone attempted an answer, others
examined the nephew and found he was without
a wound. He had swooned under the
sudden pressure of the horse shot by his
uncle, but he quickly recovered, and, after
being assisted to his feet and shaking himself
together, everything came back to him.
Turning to Thunderbolt he ordered him to
rise, and the animal obeyed. He had received
a couple of flesh-wounds, which stung him for
the moment without incapacitating him for
effective service.</p>
<p>Then, in as few words as possible, Avon told
his story. He remembered that his uncle was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
wounded before his horse was killed, and it
was self-evident to everyone that the poor
man had been carried off by the Comanches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see Shackaye among &rsquo;em?&rdquo;
asked Gleeson, his face like a thunder-cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not with those who attacked us;
I could not have failed to see him if he had
been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what became of him? He started off
with you, and you must have parted somewhere
on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Burnet now told about Shackaye&rsquo;s
encounter with the steer which came near slaying
him. Avon&rsquo;s pursuit of the other troublesome
animal withdrew all attention from him,
and there was no certainty of the manner of
his disappearance, which, to say the least, was
extraordinary.</p>
<p>But the absence of Captain Shirril forbade
that the cowboys should waste time in idleness.
Instinctively every eye was turned
toward the hills to the eastward among
which the Comanches had vanished with their
captive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t had time to go far,&rdquo; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
Zach Collis, &ldquo;and if we ride hard we shall
soon run &rsquo;em down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is it best to try that?&rdquo; was the question
of Ward Burrell, or Old Bronze.</p>
<p>Gleeson, who was naturally looked upon as
the leader, shook his head. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll brain
him the minute there&rsquo;s a chance of losing
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did they take him off and spare
<i>me</i>?&rdquo; asked the astonished Avon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They thought you was dead and so didn&rsquo;t
bother with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did they make him prisoner instead
of doing what they had been trying so long to
do&ndash;&ndash;kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s of more account than you; <i>he</i> was
the chap they was after, and not <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looked for a time as though they had
designs on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words of the Texan acted like a damper
on the ardor of his companions, who were eager
to hasten to the rescue of their captain. Had
they not known that he was wounded, it is
likely they would have insisted upon an instant
and vigorous pursuit; but none failed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
to see the truth of Gleeson&rsquo;s utterances, though
it was only a few minutes before that he was
as impatient as any of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, observing that they were
looking at him, &ldquo;I think you know what all
this means as well as I do. If we had &rsquo;em out
on the plains where there was a fair chance, or
if the cap could put in some licks for himself,
it would be different; but they&rsquo;re among them
hills over there; they&rsquo;re watching us now; we
can&rsquo;t make a move that they won&rsquo;t know it
the minute it&rsquo;s started; they&rsquo;ve got it on us,
and just as soon as they see there&rsquo;s any show
of losing the cap they&rsquo;ll finish him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ballyhoo is right,&rdquo; remarked Wynwood,
commonly known as Madstone; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got
us foul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That being so, there aint any use for you,
pards; so go back to camp, look after the
cattle, and leave things to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meaning of this proposition, which may
sound strange to the reader, was that the only
possible way of saving Captain Shirril was by
negotiating for his release. The fact that the
Comanches knew he was in charge of two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
thousand cattle, and had made him prisoner
instead of slaying him, established this truth
in the minds of Oscar Gleeson and his comrades.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Texan was confirmed in his
belief that the act of Shackaye in joining the
company before the start was the first step in
an elaborate plot. It was his province to win
the confidence of the captain, and to communicate,
in the many secret ways so well understood
by his people, with the Comanches, and
to help when the time came for the important
movement.</p>
<p>His absence at the critical period gave color
to this theory. Circumstances had helped the
treacherous red men, for it was as if Captain
Shirril walked directly into the trap set by
them.</p>
<p>It was a brave act on Gleeson&rsquo;s part to venture
alone among the hills in the hope of
opening communication with the red men,
when, if there was any mistake, he would be
completely at their mercy. But he had
uttered his decision with the air and manner
of one who would brook no dispute. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
waved his friends off, and, wheeling about,
they rode in the direction of the camp, frequently
looking back at the daring fellow
who realized as fully as they the delicate and
perilous task he had taken upon himself.</p>
<p>Reaching the top of the ridge which has
been referred to so often, the first glance was
at the herd of cattle, which it was instantly
seen required looking after. They had
drifted far to the westward, and were so scattered
as to need rounding-up in a general way
or rather herding. Everything was favorable
for good progress that day, since the stream
to be crossed was small and shallow, and the
sky was not only clear but the air just crisp
enough to render travelling pleasant. But
there was no thought of going forward until
the fate of the captain was settled.</p>
<p>With only a brief halt the cowboys spurred
their mustangs down the slope to attend to
the cattle, but Avon Burnet remained on the
crest, his interest lying elsewhere.</p>
<p>There was only a single small field glass in
the company, and as it happened that was in
the possession of Captain Shirril, so that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
youth had to depend upon his unaided vision.
But the atmosphere in the Southwest is generally
of crystalline clearness, and he was able
to see his friend quite plainly until the hill
beyond should hide him from view.</p>
<p>At the moment Avon turned the head of
his horse toward the east, the Texan was
quite close to the place where the Comanches
had taken refuge with their prisoner. His
horse was walking slowly, and it was evident
he was on the watch for some sign from the
red men who held the key to the situation.
As he drew nearer his mustang moved still
more deliberately, until it was hard to decide
whether he was advancing at all.</p>
<p>Looking closely, however, he perceived that
Gleeson&rsquo;s progress had not ceased, and he
was making some kind of signal. He had
removed the handkerchief from around his
neck, and was fluttering it over his head.
Although its color debarred it from serving
as the regulation flag of truce, there was little
doubt that the meaning of its owner would be
understood by whomsoever saw it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, there they are!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>This exclamation was uttered a few minutes
later, when the watcher on the crest caught
sight, not of one but of two Indians, who
emerged from the hills on foot. They walked
directly toward the Texan, their actions
proving that they appeared in answer to his
signal.</p>
<p>Gleeson, on perceiving them, brought his
steed to a stand still and awaited their coming.
None could have known better than he
that he was within range of the companions
of these two warriors, who could shoot him
from his horse in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they will do it, too,&rdquo; said Avon to
himself, as the thought came to him; &ldquo;but I
believe I shall take a hand in this business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, without waiting to observe the result
of the interview, the young man set out to
execute an extraordinary resolution that was
formed on the spur of the moment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<h3>DIPLOMACY.</h3>
</div>
<p>Oscar Gleeson, the Texan, was correct
in his suspicion of the purpose of the
Comanches in making Captain Shirril their
prisoner; having secured possession of him,
they intended to force a liberal ransom on the
part of his friends, as a condition of his restoration
to liberty.</p>
<p>The act was not only an audacious one on
their part, but it will be perceived that the
fulfilment of the terms was certain to be attended
with the gravest difficulty. The cowboys
were not to be trifled with, and, since it
was inevitable that a point would be reached
where one party must of necessity trust the
pledges of the other, a violent collision with
serious consequences appeared unavoidable.</p>
<p>It has been shown that it was not until he
arrived close to the hills, among which the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
red men had fled with their captive, that there
was any response to the signal he displayed
almost from the first.</p>
<p>The moment he caught sight of the two warriors,
he stopped his mustang and awaited
their approach. It was not singular that a
man who had crossed the Indian Nation so frequently
as this veteran, recognized the couple
as Wygwind, the chieftain, and Richita,
whom he had met more than once and knew
to be two of the worst miscreants belonging to
the American race.</p>
<p>With no evidence, however, of his identification,
he deliberately lowered his flag of truce,
and returning it to its place around his brawny
neck, secured it by tying the usual knot.
Then with a half military salute he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the white man with you hurt bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt not much,&rdquo; replied Wygwind, who
spoke English far better than his comrade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you take him away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The American Indian, as a rule, is of melancholy
temperament, but at this question the
Comanche displayed an unmistakable grin
which revealed his even white teeth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We sell him&ndash;&ndash;he worth good much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What price do you ask for him?&rdquo; demanded
Gleeson, coming to the point with
undiplomatic abruptness.</p>
<p>The expectation of the Texan was that these
ambassadors would demand a large number
of cattle, probably five hundred, in exchange
for their valuable captive. He ardently hoped
that such would prove the case, for he had
already formed a scheme for paying off the
rogues in their own coin.</p>
<p>His intention was to transfer the cattle,
managing the payment, however, with such
care that all breach of faith on the part of the
captain&rsquo;s enemies would be frustrated. Then,
after he was safe with his friends, and the
property was placed in the hands of the Comanches,
it would be necessary for the red
men to <i>hold</i> them. The field would become
an open one, and before they could turn their
newly acquired property to account, they were
likely to hear from the original proprietors.</p>
<p>But Wygwind was too shrewd to be
ensnared in this style. He and his partners,
in elaborating the scheme that had worked so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
well up to this point, had foreseen the very
contingency in the mind of the white man,
who sat on his horse before the delegates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We take horses&ndash;&ndash;so many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In making this answer, Wygwind raised the
fingers and thumbs of his hands twice in succession.
Unable to count a score in the
English language, he proved nevertheless that
he had a clear idea of the number, which was
indicated so plainly that the Texan could
make no mistake as to his meaning.</p>
<p>Gleeson was disappointed as well as surprised.
Since each cowboy was provided with
at least three horses, there were about thirty
with the company. To turn two-thirds of
these over to the red men would seriously
cripple the whites, who had still a long journey
before them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it must effect a material
change in the programme the Texan had
formed. Horseflesh is as dear to the red as
to the white man, and, well mounted as the
former would be after the exchange, the
chances of recovering the property by the
Texans must be reduced to the minimum.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></div>
<p>But the new phase of affairs had to be met.
Suppressing all evidence of his feelings, Gleeson
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not enough horses to give what
you ask; we will let you have <i>that</i> many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he held up the thumb and fingers of
his right hand. Wygwind with another grin
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take <i>so</i> many&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and he repeated the
gestures by which he first indicated twenty.</p>
<p>Gleeson now doubled his offer, which, it
will be understood, was half the price demanded;
but the wily Comanche felt that he
was in a position to dictate terms, and remained
inexorable.</p>
<p>The Texan knew it was useless to haggle,
but he kept it up with a view of gaining time.
Naturally keen-witted and trained in the subtlety
of the dusky men of the plains, he
sought to do more than dispute over the conditions
of a proposed bargain. While thus
employed, he used his senses to their fullest
extent. Without seeming to do so, he was
scrutinizing the hills just beyond the couple,
on the ground in front of him. He sought to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
learn whether any of their warriors were at
hand. They might have been, without his
knowledge, but the fact that he saw no sign
of them led him to believe they were not
within immediate call.</p>
<p>Had he been confronted by a single warrior
instead of a couple, the Texan would have
attempted an exploit in which there was
hardly one chance in a hundred of succeeding.
It was to seize the warrior, make off
with him, and then hold him as a hostage
for the safety of Captain Shirril.</p>
<p>True, this was a violation of the flag of
truce, but under the circumstances it would
not have been one-tenth as flagrant as that by
which our government captured the famous
Seminole chieftain Osceola, and held him
prisoner until his death; but with two
doughty warriors to combat, it would seem
that nothing could be more foolhardy than
any such effort on the part of the Texan.</p>
<p>And yet Gleeson seriously asked himself
whether it was not possible to shoot one, and
leaping upon the other, overcome and carry
him off before his friends could interfere. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
referring to it afterward he admitted its
absurdity, and yet he would have made the
attempt but for a trifling discovery when
almost in the act of taking the decisive
step.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXXIII_DRIVEN_TO_THE_WALL' id='CHAPTER_XXXIII_DRIVEN_TO_THE_WALL'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<h3>DRIVEN TO THE WALL.</h3>
</div>
<p>The discovery which checked Oscar Gleeson
was the presence of nearly all the
Comanches within a hundred feet of the warriors
that were holding their conference with
him. The signs could not be mistaken, and
the Texan abandoned the hopeless scheme he
had formed.</p>
<p>The Texan thus found himself forced back
upon the original proposition of Wygwind,
which was the ransom of the wounded
captain for twenty horses. The price under
the circumstances was large, but it could not
be questioned that the principal individual
concerned would have paid far more, for
&ldquo;what will not a man give in exchange for
his life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It remained to decide upon the method of
carrying out the agreement, and again the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
wily Wygwind displayed his shrewdness.
When the Texan referred in his offhand
manner to himself and friends as bringing forward
the animals to be passed to these two
representatives, the Comanche replied that no
one but Gleeson himself must act in the transaction.
His appearance on the crest of the
ridge, with the string of horses, would be the
signal for Wygwind and Richita to bring forward
Captain Shirril and to release him simultaneously
with the driving forward of the
animals. The exchange, therefore, could be
effected without either party gaining the
upper hand.</p>
<p>It was thus the Comanche stated the situation,
and on the face of it, everything
appeared equitable, but it was hard for the
Texan to repress his chagrin, for he saw that
every possible advantage remained with the
red men. They would group themselves
among the hills, so near that not only the
prisoner, but Gleeson himself would be within
range of their rifles, until the last act of the
drama should be completed. There was no
chance for any dash on the part of the cowboys,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
by which they could secure their leader
and save their property. Had the Texan
been allowed to bring his party with him,
such an attempt would have followed with a
fair prospect of success.</p>
<p>But he had learned long before to accept
the ills of life with grim philosophy, and he
did not permit the diplomats to observe any
evidence of his resentment at being overreached
by them. While he was convinced
that they would neglect no opportunity to
break faith, he acted as if there was not a
doubt in his mind.</p>
<p>The agreement required him to return to
camp to secure the animals, and he intimated
that considerable time must elapse before the
exchange could be effected. Wygwind assured
him he would be on the watch for his
appearance, and, whatever delay took place
should not be chargeable to <i>him</i>. With this
understanding, the Texan wheeled and galloped
toward the ridge, beyond which he
knew his comrades were awaiting his return
and report.</p>
<p>It was received as he expected; that is to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
say, the views of his friends were almost as
numerous as themselves. Ward, Burrell, and
Andy Wynwood, the cowboys from Arkansas,
declared that there was but one thing to do,
and that was to accept the terms offered.
Gleeson was quite certain the Comanches
would fulfil their part in spirit and letter,
for they could not fail to know that any attempted
trickery on their part would be
followed by an attack so instant and fierce
that they must suffer severely, even with the
hill to serve them for refuge.</p>
<p>Zach Collis took the opposite view, maintaining
that the only result of the plan would
be that the Comanches would secure twenty
valuable ponies without benefiting Captain
Shirril in the least. They were so villainous
by nature that they would shoot him down,
after he had left their lines, and more than
likely would bring Gleeson himself from the
saddle. The New Mexican favored a pretended
compliance with the proposition. He
wished all to ride to the ridge with the horses,
where they would halt, while the Texan went
forward with them. This would not violate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
the conditions imposed by Wygwind, and
they could watch proceedings from the elevation.
At the proper moment, when Gleeson
saw the captain was out of range, he could
give the signal and the company on the ridge
would spur forward at headlong speed, with
the certain result of making matters lively
for a time.</p>
<p>Joseph George Garland advocated a fair
exchange through and through. He insisted
what no one could dispute, that the red men
had secured the upper hand, and it was fortunate
that they were willing to restore the
captain on any terms. If they complied with
their pledge, honor required the whites to be
equally scrupulous in fulfilling their agreement.
When their leader rejoined them, the
twenty horses became the rightful property of
the Comanches, though he was willing to
admit they were subject to reprisal.</p>
<p>Antonio Nunez shrugged his shoulders and
said he was willing to do whatever the others
decided upon. He had no proposition of his
own to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Baby?&rdquo; asked Gleeson, looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
around with surprise, having missed him for
the first time. &ldquo;I would like to know what
<i>he</i> thinks, since every pard has his own
views.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The enquiry developed the fact that Avon
Burnet had not returned to camp since his
departure with Captain Shirril and Shackaye.
Had the others not been so busily occupied,
immediately after their own return, in looking
after the cattle, they would have noticed that
he remained seated on his horse for some
minutes on the crest of the ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the Texan, after studying
the &ldquo;lay of the land&rdquo; for some minutes.
&ldquo;He has ridden along the ridge on this side
and got among the hills back of where I was
talking with Wygwind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll be the result of <i>that</i>?&rdquo; asked
Hauser Files, who had not yet expressed his
views of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will play the mischief with everything,&rdquo;
was the truthful reply of the Texan,
who added excitedly: &ldquo;There he comes now
as if old Nick was after him!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<h3>THE FLANK MOVEMENT.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was singular that the youngest member
of the cattlemen should make an important
discovery, which not only escaped them,
but, as subsequent events proved, was not
noticed, or at least did not receive due attention
from the Comanches themselves.</p>
<p>Avon Burnet, from his place on the crest
of elevation, was watching the interview between
Gleeson and the two red men, when he
awoke to the fact that the ridge joined and
formed a part of the hills among which the
Comanches had taken refuge. That is to say,
one had only to follow the former to reach the
broken swell containing the warriors and
their prisoner.</p>
<p>If such a ride were made along the right
slope, the person must be in plain sight of
the Indians; if along the crest, he would be
visible to those on the right and left, and, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
along the left slope, the cowboys could see
him while he would not be perceived by the
red men themselves, unless they were on the
watch.</p>
<p>These facts were apparent to Avon at the
first sweeping glance he cast to the eastward.
He wondered that they escaped the notice of
his friends, but this was probably due to their
attention being diverted for the time by the
cattle, and because, too, of their disposition
to wait the report of Gleeson before deciding
upon their course of action.</p>
<p>The thought instantly came to Avon that
if the cowboys would make a sudden break
along the base of the slope to the left, they
could reach the rear of the Comanches, always
provided the latter had taken no precautions
against such a flank movement. The plan of
campaign was so inviting that he could hardly
believe it had been overlooked by the red
men. At any rate, before urging his friends
to adopt it, he decided to make a little investigation
on his own account, especially as he
believed sufficient time was at command.</p>
<p>Riding, therefore, to the bottom of the slope,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
he spurred Thunderbolt to a sharp gait, and
quickly covered the intervening space, which
was hardly a fourth of a mile. His mustang
showed no ill effects from the slight wounds
received during the sharp scrimmage some
time before.</p>
<p>Avon was well aware of the risk he ran, for,
if the Comanches were maintaining guard,
they could readily pick him off before he could
withdraw or adopt the least precaution, but he
did not hesitate. When the ground became
more broken, he urged his pony a short way
among the hills, and then dismounted. He
did this, because he wished to hold his line of
retreat open. The way behind him was clear,
whereas, if he took his horse further, the
course would become so obstructed that he
could not mount and dash out upon the plain
if it became necessary.</p>
<p>He expected to make a long and tedious
search, with the probable result of failure, so
far as helping his relative was concerned,
and with the certainty of great danger to himself,
but events moved along with a rush, before
he could anticipate them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>Convinced that he was to the rear of the
main party, he advanced with the utmost care.
The hills were no more than a hundred feet
high at their greatest elevation, and were
broken by gullies, ravines, and trails that
appeared to have been partly made by the
feet of animals, greatly helped by the washing
of the severe storms which often sweep
over that section.</p>
<p>The youth had penetrated barely a hundred
yards from the point where he left his
mustang, and was picking his way cautiously
forward, when he was startled by hearing
voices. The words were too low for him to
distinguish them, but he instantly stopped
with his Winchester ready for use. A collision
seemed unavoidable, since there was no
means of concealing himself except by turning
about and running back, and that could
hardly avail him.</p>
<p>The next minute he was face to face with
Shackaye, the young Comanche that was the
cause of all the trouble. The fellow was as
much startled as he, and stopping short, partly
raised his gun, as if to defend himself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></div>
<p>Before, however, either could speak or make
any movements, Avon was astounded to catch
sight of his uncle, Captain Shirril, walking
slowly and evidently in pain, close behind him
along the narrow path. The instant he descried
his nephew, he raised his hand as a
signal for him to do nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said, in a guarded
voice; &ldquo;Shackaye is our friend, though he
hasn&rsquo;t been until now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; asked the youth, motionless
and undecided whether to advance or retreat.</p>
<p>The broad face of the dusky youth expanded
with a slight grin, and he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shackaye fall on ground&ndash;&ndash;Baby shoot steer&ndash;&ndash;Shackaye
tell warriors Baby dead&ndash;&ndash;leaving
him alone&ndash;&ndash;bringing way captain&ndash;&ndash;den Shackaye
show captain way home&ndash;&ndash;must hurry&ndash;&ndash;Comanche
come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a horse with you?&rdquo; asked Captain
Shirril, crowding forward, impatient to
improve the precious moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner had been deprived of all his
weapons, and was suffering from the severe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
hurts received, but he roused himself and
moved forward at a brisk walk, Avon taking
the lead, with the young Indian close behind
him and the captain at his heels.</p>
<p>Very few minutes were required to pass over
the intervening space, but while doing so
Captain Shirril made clear several facts which
needed explanation. To these may be added
others that came to light afterward.</p>
<p>As has been intimated elsewhere, the suspicions
of Gleeson regarding Shackaye were
correct. He had joined the cattlemen for the
purpose of helping Wygwind and his band to
despoil them. He was unable to do this at
the time the cabin was attacked, and therefore
kept in the background until the present
opportunity presented itself. The intention
of the Comanches, as first formed, was to
stampede the animals on some favorable
night, and thus secure possession of a large
number; but there was great risk in the
attempt, since the cowboys were watchful,
and the cattle being branded, it would have
been almost impossible for the thieves to dispose
of them, even if able to run them beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
reach of their owners. The Great Cattle Trail
is about a hundred yards in width, with
smaller paths weaving in and out along the
edges, all so distinctly marked that no one can
go astray, unless the path is temporarily obliterated
by snow. The diversion of a considerable
number of cattle would leave footprints
that could be readily followed, and Captain
Dohm Shirril was not the man to submit to
such despoilment, so long as there remained
the possibility of preventing it.</p>
<p>The Comanches, however, in the vicinity of
the herd kept track of all its movements.
The cunning Shackaye succeeded in holding
occasional communication with them, and
learned of their change of plan. It was
decided to make the captain prisoner on the
first opportunity, and hold him for ransom.</p>
<p>Since it was his practice to take his nephew
with him on almost every excursion he made
from camp, Shackaye conceived it necessary to
the success of the plot that Avon should be
put out of the way. It has been shown that
he made the attempt on the preceding night
and came within a hair of success. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
characteristic of his race that the atrocious
crime was undertaken by him as a matter of
course.</p>
<p>The very chance for which Wygwind and
his band were waiting came that morning
when Captain Shirril, his nephew, and Shackaye
set out to hunt the estray cattle. While
Avon was engaged in conquering the troublesome
steer, with the captain attentively watching
him, Shackaye remounted his horse, from
which he had been thrown, and made all haste
to the hills.</p>
<p>Wygwind and his warriors were ready, and
indeed met him on his way thither. He took
no part in the fight, but watched it from his
refuge. When the last desperate struggle
took place he spurred forward and joined the
assailants.</p>
<p>The intention of the Comanches had been to
shoot down Avon, but to spare his uncle, and
it was curious that the very opposite result
was effected. It was impossible that Captain
Shirril should escape in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, though his
foes meant only to shoot down the horses and
slay his companion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></div>
<p>Shackaye arrived at the critical moment,
when the helpless leader was being lifted upon
the horse of Wygwind in front of him, and
Avon lay senseless beneath the body of the
mustang. The fact that Thunderbolt was still
lying on the ground bleeding from his two
flesh wounds led to the belief that he was mortally
hurt, and no effort, therefore, was made
to take him away.</p>
<p>Despite the savage nature of Shackaye, a
feeling of gratitude had been roused within
him by the act of Avon in saving him from the
enraged steer. Whether the white youth was
already dead or not he did not know, but he
interposed a vigorous plea that no further
harm should be done him. He had performed
his own part so well that his prayers had some
effect, while the necessity for urgent haste in
leaving before the arrival of the cowboys, who
were coming over the ridge, led to the flight
of the whole party of Comanches without
harming a hair of his head.</p>
<p>It will be readily understood that none of
the warriors could hold any suspicion of
Shackaye&rsquo;s loyalty toward them and their interests.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
When, therefore, the time came for
the opening of the negotiations with the cowboys,
the wounded and unarmed captain was
left in charge of Shackaye, while the others
went forward and maintained their places
within reach of Wygwind and Richita, during
their interview with Gleeson. This was simply
prudence on their part, since they knew there
was the best reason for believing the whites
would instantly seize any advantage offered
them.</p>
<p>Captain Shirril now did an exceedingly clever
thing. He saw it was useless to appeal to
Shackaye&rsquo;s kindly feelings toward himself,
but he had noticed his vigorous efforts to save
his nephew from harm, when he lay senseless
under the body of the mustang. He saw that,
despite the villainous nature of the youth, he
entertained a strong regard for Avon, and upon
that regard he wrought, by representing the
sorrow that would come to him, if his uncle
suffered further. He knew his heart would be
broken and he could never, never recover from
his woe.</p>
<p>To Shackaye&rsquo;s reply that the chief Wygwind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
meant to allow the friends of the prisoner
to buy him back, Captain Shirril dwelt upon
the impossibility of such a thing. He pressed
his view of the case with such vigor that
Shackaye, influenced alone by his gratitude
to Avon, agreed to conduct the captain out
of the hills, where he could make his way to
camp undetected, provided the interview between
Wygwind and the Texan was not
ended in time for the Comanches to discover
what had been done.</p>
<p>It need not be said that Captain Shirril
seized the opportunity thus offered, and
began limping forward, behind his guide, who
encountered Avon Burnet a few minutes later.</p>
<p>The expectation was that Shackaye would
return to camp with his two friends, since he
would be assured of good treatment despite
his former unfaithfulness, and especially since
it was unsafe for him to remain among those
to whom he could never justify his course of
action. But after the captain was assisted on
the back of Thunderbolt, and his nephew took
his place, so as to help him in keeping his seat,
the young Comanche obstinately refused.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></div>
<p>They tarried to urge him to save his life by
such a course, but he ended the argument by
abruptly turning about and hurrying along
the path, where he speedily vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use of waiting,&rdquo; said the captain,
starting Thunderbolt forward; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
understand his obduracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be afraid of our men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he knows the danger is a thousandfold
greater among his own people&ndash;&ndash;hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sharp report of a rifle rang among the
hills behind them, accompanied by a wild cry
of mortal pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has paid with his life for his friendship!&rdquo;
whispered the captain, instantly
spurring up Thunderbolt to a dead run.</p>
<p>Such was the truth. Shackaye could offer
no excuse for what he had done, nor did he
attempt to do so. His act was discovered
sooner than he anticipated, and he died at the
hands of the infuriated chieftain Wygwind,
before those whom he had saved were beyond
reach of the sound which told of the completion
of the tragedy.</p>
<p>The Comanches attempted pursuit, but the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
start obtained by the fugitives, brief as it was,
sufficed, and they had not ridden far when
they met the whole band of cowboys galloping
to their defence. Gleeson and his comrades
would have been glad had the red men
ventured out upon the plain beyond the
shelter of the hills, but Wygwind and his
warriors were too wise to do so.</p>
